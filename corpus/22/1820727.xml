        <p>Stanford University and the Public Theater in New York have announced a long-term partnership that includes an annual residency program at Stanford for playwrights developing work for the Public, joint commissions for one playwright a year, and three annual fellowships for Stanford undergraduates and graduates with the artistic staff of the Public. David Henry Hwang, a Stanford alumnus, will be the playwright in the residency program this year. Starting next month Mr. Hwang will spend several weeks at Stanford, in Palo Alto, Calif., working on his new play, ''Yellow Face,'' which will be performed as staged readings before being presented at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in May and at the Public Theater next season. For the 2007-8 residency, the director JoAnne Akalaitis will present a new version of Euripides' ''Bacchae,'' with music by Philip Glass, in a workshop production.</p>
