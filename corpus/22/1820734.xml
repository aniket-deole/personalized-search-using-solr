        <p>Three suspects accused of attacking an off-duty police officer, gravely injuring him, were ordered held without bail yesterday.</p>
        <p>The suspects -- Lamont Lafoucade, 33, and Darvell Williams, 21, both from Brooklyn, and Thelma Lopez, 28, of the Bronx -- were arraigned on charges of gang assault. Mr. Lafoucade was also charged with driving while intoxicated. He is on parole after serving nine years in prison for attempted murder, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams was convicted of third-degree assault last year, but it was unclear last night if he served time in prison, the police said. Ms. Lopez was arrested in December for assault on an officer and released, the officials said. She is awaiting a hearing on the charge next month.</p>
        <p>One of the officers, Richard Lomax, 29, suffered a skull fracture and bleeding on the brain. He was in critical but stable condition last night at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, the police said. The second officer, Robert DiFazio, 21, was released from St. Vincent's hospital on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The police said Officer Lomax was driving his Ford Explorer when he crashed into a Nissan Maxima about 4 a.m. on Saturday on 10th Avenue near 28th Street in Chelsea, because of icy road conditions. The police said the officers got out of their car to talk with the occupants of the Nissan and were attacked.</p>
        <p>Raymond L. Loving, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who represents Mr. Williams, disputed the police account and suggested the assault might not have been unprovoked. He also questioned whether one of the officers had been drinking.</p>
        <p>The police said yesterday that the officers were not tested for alcohol in their blood because there was no reason to suspect that drinking contributed to the accident.</p>
