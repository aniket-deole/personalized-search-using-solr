        <p>Gerard Grandinetti, the federal official in charge of overseeing and hiring 1,100 airport screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport, has resigned. Ann Davis, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Security Administration, confirmed yesterday that Mr. Grandinetti resigned on Friday, citing personal reasons. Last week The Newark Star-Ledger reported allegations that some job candidates for senior management posts had received questions in advance that were on a test for prospective employees. After the allegations, officials canceled the test and started an internal investigation. Mr. Grandinetti could not be reached for comment.</p>
