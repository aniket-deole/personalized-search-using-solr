        <p>The political odd couples are not only on the Democratic side of the Nassau State Senate race.</p>
        <p>The Republican candidate, Maureen O'Connell, recently wrote a letter to Governor Spitzer urging him to support a Nassau County Democrat, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, below, for state comptroller.</p>
        <p>''As the taxpayers' advocate, the state comptroller must possess independence and integrity,'' Ms. O'Connell wrote in the letter, which was also published in a local newspaper. ''Assemblyman DiNapoli personifies these traits and, through his lifetime of public service, he has earned the public's trust.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DiNapoli is one of at least 18 people -- lawmakers, current or former officials and businessmen -- seeking to replace the former comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned after pleading guilty to a felony for using a state worker to chauffeur his wife.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Connell, who is running in a district where registered Democrats now outnumber registered Republicans, said in an interview that she had not yet run into any Republicans who were miffed that she would back a Democrat for the high-profile office.</p>
        <p>Since Democrats will have the upper hand in choosing the next comptroller, few Republicans expressed any interest in the race -- with one exception being Andrew S. Eristoff, a commissioner of tax and finance in the Pataki administration.</p>
        <p>''The reason I wrote the letter is because I've known Tom DiNapoli for a long time,'' Ms. O'Connell, herself a former assemblywoman from the area, said in an interview. ''I think he's the right person for the job. He's a man of character and integrity and honesty.''</p>
