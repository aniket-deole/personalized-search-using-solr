        <p>When Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert, who plays a caricature of a self-involved conservative pundit on ''The Colbert Report,'' exchanged guest stints Thursday with Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News host whom Mr. Colbert affectionately calls ''Papa Bear,'' ratings for both shows surged. According to Nielsen, Mr. O'Reilly's appearance helped ''The Colbert Report'' garner 1.7 million viewers at 11:30 p.m., a record high in that show's 15-month history. Earlier in the night, from 8 to 9 p.m., ''The O'Reilly Factor'' saw its ratings soar 46 percent over its fourth-quarter average last year, to nearly 3 million viewers. Among ''Factor'' viewers ages 25 to 54, a demographic in which Mr. Colbert's show regularly draws more viewers, the increase was even more pronounced. Mr. O'Reilly's show improved from an average of 450,000 viewers in that age group to 750,000.</p>
