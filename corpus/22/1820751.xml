        <p>Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat, left, a Manhattan Democrat, said yesterday that he would introduce legislation to create an 11-member investment review commission to monitor certain investment decisions made by the state comptroller's office. The office is the sole trustee of the state's Common Retirement Fund, which provides pension, death and disability benefits to public employees. Mr. Espaillat, chairman of a task force of black, Hispanic and Asian-American state lawmakers, said the commission would focus on social investment goals for the fund, like promoting economic development in urban and rural areas that are struggling economically.</p>
