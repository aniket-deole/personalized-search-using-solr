        <p>Shortly before he took office, Governor Spitzer said he would do away with the Pataki-era practice of having appointees to various commissions switch their party affiliations to circumvent rules requiring political balance on the boards.</p>
        <p>''The game that has been played there, unfortunately, is that sometimes people have been asked to switch their party affiliation in order to create the appearance of balance when in fact it wasn't there,'' Mr. Spitzer said.

        <p>Shortly before he took office, Governor Spitzer said he would do away with the Pataki-era practice of having appointees to various commissions switch their party affiliations to circumvent rules requiring political balance on the boards.</p>
        <p>''The game that has been played there, unfortunately, is that sometimes people have been asked to switch their party affiliation in order to create the appearance of balance when in fact it wasn't there,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''We are not going to permit anybody to change their party affiliation in order to generate that supposed neutrality or bipartisanship.''</p>
        <p>The practice appears to have been in play right up to the end of his predecessor's reign.</p>
        <p>On his way out the door, John P. Cahill, below left, who was Gov. George E. Pataki's top deputy, got an appointment as a commissioner on the State Commission of Investigation, a body that was set up in the 1950s to investigate organized crime and that now produces occasional reports on criminal justice issues.</p>
        <p>It is known as a plum job, with a good salary for relatively few hours of work. The commission meets at least once every two weeks, a spokesman for the commission said.</p>
        <p>There was one problem: Mr. Cahill's appointment would have put one Republican too many on the six-member commission. Luckily, the commission's chairman, Alfred Lerner, a former judge, had changed his party affiliation from Republican to Independent a few months earlier, paving the way for another Republican appointee.</p>
        <p>''The judge changed his enrollment in the late summer of last year,'' said Steven A. Greenberg, a spokesman for the commission.</p>
        <p>He said that Mr. Pataki did not ask Mr. Lerner to make the switch, but that ''the judge felt that he wanted to give Governor Pataki as much flexibility as possible to fill the vacancy.''</p>
