        <p>More than four times as many households downloaded videos from file-sharing networks as they did from centralized services like iTunes in the third quarter of 2006.</p>
        <p>Downloads from file-sharing networks are generally free, and have long occurred outside the control of copyright holders. The cost of for-pay downloads, about 90 percent of which go through iTunes, generally includes a licensing fee.</p>
        <p>But not many of the freeloaders are actually downloading mainstream content, according to the new data on downloading, which was gathered by the NPD Group, a consumer-research firm, through tracking software installed in 12,500 households. Only about 20 percent of the videos downloaded from file-sharing networks were TV shows, and 5 percent were mainstream movies, while just under 60 percent were pornographic movies.</p>
        <p>The relative scarcity of pirated movie downloads may have more to do with legal and business pressure than with users' tastes. Many file-sharing networks are struggling to find accommodation with the movie and recording industries; for example, BitTorrent, a service whose software is on about 80 million computers, struck a deal in 2005 with the Motion Picture Association of America to remove infringing content from the search index on its Web site.</p>
