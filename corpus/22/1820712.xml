        <p>Of Montreal  ''Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?'' (Polyvinyl)</p>
        <p>Kevin Barnes, the songwriter behind Of Montreal, would be the first to admit that he thinks too much. ''I fell in love with the first cute girl that I met,'' he sings like a pop songwriter. But then he adds, ''who could appreciate Georges Bataille,'' the morbidly erotic writer who once declared, ''To become delightful happiness must be tainted with poison.''</p>
        <p>Of Montreal arrived in the 1990s as part of the Elephant 6 collective of psychedelia-loving pop experimenters in Georgia. Over the last decade Of Montreal has been a band and a one-man studio concoction, and Mr. Barnes has revealed himself not as a whimsical hippie, but as a character grappling with doubt and despondency. He moved with his wife and child to Norway in 2004, and ''Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?'' is a chronicle of isolation, bitter lovers' quarrels and borderline breakdowns: ''Daytime I'm so absent-minded, nighttime meeting new anxieties/So am I erasing myself?,'' he sings in ''Gronlandic Edit.''</p>
        <p>This time Of Montreal's music revolves around a staple of loners in studios: synthesizers, used mostly for synth-pop that looks back to the 1970s and 1980s but is warped with shifty structures and skipped beats that could trip up unwary dancers. The album's centerpiece is the 12-minute ''The Past Is a Grotesque Animal,'' pulsating steadily in a spiral of self-laceration. Manic pop and depressive revelations have rarely been so closely bonded.</p>
