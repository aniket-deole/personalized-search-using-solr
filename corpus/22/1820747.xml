        <p>The Spitzer administration is working on a major high-technology deal that will be announced in the coming weeks, according to Alain E. Kaloyeros, chief administrative officer of the State University at Albany's College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kaloyeros, who would not elaborate on the deal, had a close working relationship with former Governor Pataki and has been a key player in economic development deals that attracted technology companies to the state.</p>
        <p>He said the latest deal convinced him that he should reject two recent job offers and remain in his job, adding that he had spent the last several weeks ''working with Patrick Foye to close arguably the biggest high-tech deal for the state.'' (Mr. Foye is the new downstate chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Kaloyeros said he considered the deal to be ''even bigger than A.M.D.,'' referring to the state's roughly $1.2 billion incentive package to encourage Advanced Micro Devices to open a semiconductor factory to the Albany area.</p>
        <p>But whether the latest deal actually gets done remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>''We don't comment on rumors or speculation about potential economic development deals that may or may not happen,'' Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Governor Spitzer, said.</p>
