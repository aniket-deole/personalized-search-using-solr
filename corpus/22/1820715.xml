        <p>The Macy's corporate marketing division of Federated Department Stores shifted the duties for its national media planning and buying to Mediaedge:cia, part of the WPP Group, after 11 months at Starcom, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe. Spending was estimated at $200 million. Local media duties are handled internally. Another WPP agency, JWT, is among the Macy's creative agencies.</p>
        <p>Olympus Imaging America, Center Valley, Pa., chose Deutsch, New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle its creative and media accounts, with spending estimated at $15 million. The incumbent, the Martin Agency, Richmond, Va., also part of Interpublic, did not take part in a review for the assignments.</p>
        <p>Shine Advertising, Madison, Wis., resigned the account of GoDaddy, Scottsdale, Ariz., a month after being named agency of record.
