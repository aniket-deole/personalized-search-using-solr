        <p>Mary Stolz, a noted author for children and adolescents whose novels earned critical praise for the seriousness with which they took the problems of young people, died on Dec. 15 at her home in Longboat Key, Fla. She was 86.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stolz died of natural causes, her son, William B. Stolz, said.</p>
        <p>The author of more than 60 books, Ms. Stolz was an early practitioner of the young-adult novel. She was known in particular for her books aimed at teenage girls, among them ''Ready or Not'' (1953), ''And Love Replied'' (1958), ''Some Merry-Go-Round Music'' (1959) and ''Leap Before You Look'' (1972).</p>
        <p>Ms. Stolz spent most of her career with the Harper publishing company in its various incarnations, from Harper &amp; Brothers through Harper &amp; Row to the present-day HarperCollins. Her books for younger readers include ''The Leftover Elf'' (1952), ''Emmett's Pig'' (1959), ''A Dog on Barkham Street'' (1960) and ''The Bully of Barkham Street'' (1963).</p>
        <p>Two of Ms. Stolz's titles, ''Belling the Tiger'' (1961) and ''The Noonday Friends'' (1965), were named Newbery Honor books by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association.</p>
        <p>Concerned crucially with character, Ms. Stolz's work often centered on young protagonists' experience of first love and on their attempts to come to terms with turbulent family lives. ''Ready or Not,'' for instance, is the coming-of-age story of a 16-year-old girl living in a low-income housing project in New York City.</p>
        <p>Reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review, Ellen Lewis Buell wrote, ''The interplay of family relationships is brilliantly stated.''</p>
        <p>Mary Slattery, known as Molly, was born in Boston on March 24, 1920, and raised in Manhattan. She studied at Teachers College of Columbia University and the Katharine Gibbs school before going to work at Columbia as a secretary.</p>
        <p>During a long convalescence -- Ms. Stolz suffered from debilitating arthritis -- she began work on her first book, ''To Tell Your Love,'' writing in pencil on yellow legal pads. The novel was published in 1950 by Harper &amp; Brothers, bringing Ms. Stolz into the stable of the distinguished children's book editor Ursula Nordstrom.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stolz's first marriage, to Stanley Burr Stolz, ended in divorce; her second, to Thomas C. Jaleski, ended with his death in 2001. Besides her son, William, of Atlanta, she is survived by a stepson, Eugene Jaleski of Longboat Key; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Her other books include ''Cider Days'' (1978), ''Ivy Larkin'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986), ''A Ballad of the Civil War'' (1997) and ''Casebook of a Private (Cat's) Eye'' (Front Street/Cricket, 1999). Ms. Stolz also wrote a novel for adults, ''Truth and Consequence,'' published by Harper &amp; Brothers in 1953.</p>
