        <p>A fierce battle erupted off Sri Lanka's northern coast on Sunday when two clusters of Tamil Tiger rebel boats, including suicide craft, attacked a ship carrying food supplies.</p>
        <p>The military also fought with rebels in eastern Sri Lanka, killing 18, a military spokesman said. At least 10,000 civilians have fled the area in recent days as the fighting has surged there.</p>
        <p>The sea battle, seven miles off the northern Jaffna Peninsula, began when a Tiger suicide craft exploded close to the cargo ship City of Liverpool, damaging the vessel, which had just unloaded food supplies, including flour and rice for civilians on the peninsula. Because of the escalating fighting in recent months, Jaffna has faced a severe food shortage.</p>
        <p>Navy warships and helicopter gunships rushed to the scene and destroyed at least three of the 20 rebel boats, said Brig. Prasad Samarasinghe, a military spokesman. The ship's crew was rescued, and three sailors were wounded by the rebels, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, before they retreated.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the military routed rebels from a strategic town in eastern Sri Lanka. The bodies of 22 rebel fighters were found in the area, a former rebel stronghold, on Sunday.</p>
