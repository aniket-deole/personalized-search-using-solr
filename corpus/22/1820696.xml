        <p>It was like Muhammad Ali making nice with George Foreman. Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Nassau County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, who threw jabs at each other during last year's Democratic primary for governor, were all smiles last week when they both attended a $25,000-a-couple private fund-raiser for the state Democratic Party.</p>

        <p>It was like Muhammad Ali making nice with George Foreman. Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Nassau County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, who threw jabs at each other during last year's Democratic primary for governor, were all smiles last week when they both attended a $25,000-a-couple private fund-raiser for the state Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>There was even some good-natured, if slightly edgy, joshing, according to a Democrat who attended the fund-raiser and another who was later briefed on it.</p>
        <p>It began when the governor, top, publicly recognized his former antagonist.</p>
        <p>''Spitzer said, 'I'm glad he's here for two reasons,' '' the Democrat briefed on the exchange said. ''He said, 'First, he's been a voice for reform in New York State, and second, he didn't drive himself.' ''</p>
        <p>The governor was apparently alluding to the crash of Mr. Suozzi's county car last Tuesday, when the vehicle, driven by a police detective, went through a red light with its siren and emergency lights on and ran into another car. No one was injured.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suozzi, below left, showed that he could take the joke, telling the crowd that his race for governor was a lot like his coverage in the newspapers last week. ''A car wreck,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was the latest joint appearance of two men who showed little affection for each other last summer, when Mr. Suozzi hammered Mr. Spitzer as an Albany insider, and Mr. Spitzer fired back that Mr. Suozzi was a tax raiser.</p>
        <p>Now, the former rivals are taking their act public.</p>
        <p>They have recorded a radio ad together for Craig M. Johnson, the Democrat running for an open State Senate seat in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>The seat just happened to open when Governor Spitzer tapped its former occupant, Senator Michael A. L. Balboni, a Republican, to join his administration.</p>
