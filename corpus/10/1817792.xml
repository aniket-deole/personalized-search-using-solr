        <p>Re ''A Surprising Secret to a Long Life: Stay in School'' (''The New Age'' series, front page, Jan. 3):</p>
        <p>The growing evidence that more schooling leads to better health provides a compelling rationale for New York and other cities to make school dropout prevention a public health priority as well as an educational priority.</p>
        <p>Since disparities in health between the better-off and the poor and among whites, blacks and Latinos closely track differences in educational achievement, improving our city's abysmal school completion rates can help New York reduce inequities in health. Moreover, since better health also contributes to educational achievement, New York City should expand the number of school-based health centers, strengthen its health and sexuality education curriculum, and ensure safe and healthy environments in our schools.</p>
