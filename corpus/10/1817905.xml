        <p>New York City's short-term fiscal outlook looks very bright because the local economy remains strong and tax revenues have been coming in at higher rates than expected, according to a report released yesterday by the city's Independent Budget Office. The office projected a surplus of $2.1 billion for the 2007 fiscal year, which ends on June 30, and, assuming that that money is used to pay future expenses in advance, a surplus of $688 million for the 2008 fiscal year. The office said it expected deficits of $2.9 billion in fiscal 2009 and $2.7 billion in fiscal 2010, the last year of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's term -- but added that those projected shortfalls were smaller than what the mayor's Office of Management and Budget had projected.</p>
