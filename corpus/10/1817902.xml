        <p>Jennifer Cunningham, the top political strategist at what is considered the state's most politically powerful union -- 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East -- said yesterday that she was leaving the union to join a political consulting firm in New York City and a lobbying firm in Albany. Ms. Cunningham, a former deputy counsel to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, will become a partner at Knickerbocker SKD, a consulting firm. She will also be of counsel to Featherstonhaugh, Wiley, Clyne &amp; Cordo, a lobbying and law firm in Albany. Ms. Cunningham said she would represent 1199 on many matters. She said she was leaving 1199 to spend more time with her 14-year-old daughter. ''I don't see it as leaving the union so much as changing the nature of my relations with the union,'' she said. Dennis Rivera, 1199's president, said, ''We look forward to working with her for many years to come.''</p>
