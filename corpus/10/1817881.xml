        <p>The Foreign Ministry said it had taken note of the statement this week by the United Nations deputy special representative in Afghanistan, Chris Alexander, that Pakistan and Afghanistan had to end their ''war of words'' over their border and said it would reconsider Pakistan's announcement last month that it would lay mines along the border. The ministry said it agreed that blocking ''undesirable elements'' -- a reference to the resurgent Taliban -- from entering Pakistan was the responsibility of the forces operating on the Afghan side. President Hamid Karzai had voiced strong opposition to the plan for mines.</p>
