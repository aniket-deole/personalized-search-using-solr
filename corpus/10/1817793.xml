        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Imperial Presidency 2.0'' (editorial, Jan. 7) is right on target about urging the Democrats and moderate Republicans to re-amend the laws that Congress rushed into being before the election of 2006.</p>
        <p>As you say, this is ''not about the past.'' We need to stop the continuing assault that the Bush administration has made on our civil liberties and constitutional principles; otherwise, we are down the road to our own demise as a democratic nation.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Imperial Presidency 2.0'' (editorial, Jan. 7) is right on target about urging the Democrats and moderate Republicans to re-amend the laws that Congress rushed into being before the election of 2006.</p>
        <p>As you say, this is ''not about the past.'' We need to stop the continuing assault that the Bush administration has made on our civil liberties and constitutional principles; otherwise, we are down the road to our own demise as a democratic nation.</p>
        <p>By not allowing detainees of any stripe the basic rights of arguing the basis of their detention; by allowing the president, at his discretion only, to look at first-class mail or e-mail or listen to phone conversations, we are opening the way toward unchecked presidential power that our Constitution was deliberately designed to protect us from.</p>
        <p>The president's use of ''signing statements'' extends his disregard for law. Congress should pass a new law specifically forbidding this practice.</p>
        <p>The road toward dictatorship is begun with just such small ''signing statements'' and similar emasculations of our civil liberties as outlined in your editorial.</p>
        <p>Deborah Goodell  Ridgewood, N.J., Jan. 7, 2007</p>
