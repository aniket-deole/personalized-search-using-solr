        <p>Investigators inspected the wreckage of five oceanfront homes in Malibu on Tuesday trying to determine the cause of a fast-moving fire the night before that destroyed them and damaged several others.</p>
        <p>The actress Suzanne Somers, best known for her role as Chrissy in the 1970's sitcom ''Three's Company'' and as a promoter of health and exercise products on cable television, was among the people who lost their homes in the fire.</p>
        <p>''I really think that we'll learn something great from this,'' Ms. Somers told reporters on a visit to the remains of her house on Tuesday morning. ''What else can you do with a tragedy, but look for the opportunity to grow spiritually and emotionally? And I know that we'll learn something great. It was a beautiful house. It was a beautiful place to live.''</p>
        <p>She said she planned to rebuild.</p>
        <p>Ms. Somers and her husband and manager, Alan Hamel, were not home at the time of the fire, which began about 5 p.m. Monday in nearby Malibu Bluffs State Park, off Malibu Road. About 300 firefighters using 40 trucks and a few water-dropping helicopters brought it under control by 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>No one was seriously injured.</p>
        <p>The fire had spread quickly. It began as a relatively minor brush fire, but, whipped by winds gusting to more than 30 miles per hour, it consumed the houses and 20 acres within a half-hour.</p>
        <p>''There was very little warning,'' said Ron Harelson, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. ''It was a miracle no other homes were lost or civilians were killed.''</p>
        <p>Inspector Sam Padilla of the Fire Department said the cause had not been determined.</p>
        <p>Neighborhood residents, whose homes sit in close proximity to one another, dashed to save their property on Monday. The actress Victoria Principal was seen watering down her property with a garden hose.</p>
        <p>The identities of the owners of the destroyed houses and the six that were damaged were not released.</p>
        <p>Chief P. Michael Freeman of the Fire Department initially estimated damage at $60 million, but officials later said the figure was being reassessed.</p>
        <p>Malibu, where the rich and famous live along choice beaches and rugged hills, has periodic disastrous fires, floods and mudslides. A fire in November 1993 near the same area as Monday's killed three people and destroyed a few hundred homes.</p>
