        <p>TOLKSDORF--Simone Stakolt, remember her as she was, sensitive, vivacious, quick-witted, and loving. She was born in Russia, educated in Poland and France, and orphaned in Warsaw in September, 1939. She obtained a degree in political science at the Louvre. Emigrating to the United States in 1946, she became the head buyer for Peck &amp; Peck in New York City. Simone was formerly married to Kurt Tolksdorf, President and CEO of Langenbacher Woodworking, famous throughout the world. Mr. Tolksdorf died in 1985. Simone died on January 8, 2007 and is survived by her husband of the past 19 years, Richard C. Miller, Boca Raton, Florida. A Memorial Service will be held at 10:00 am on Saturday, January 27, 2007 at Babione Funeral Home (East Chapel). ''A lovely smile and hair of gold, always sweet and sometimes bold, our love was great and ne'er did wane, I pray that we will meet again.'' Babione Funeral Home is in charge of services. 561-395-8787</p>
