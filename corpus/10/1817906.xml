        <p>A 17-year-old boy was stabbed once in the chest by another teenager yesterday afternoon on a subway train in Brooklyn, the police said. The victim, whom the authorities did not identify, was taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition, the police said. The stabbing occurred about 3 p.m. aboard a Manhattan-bound J train that was stopped in the elevated Norwood Avenue station, near Fulton Street in Highland Park, officials said. Detectives were investigating whether it followed an argument between the two teenagers earlier in the day. Charles Seaton, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said that train service was suspended in the area through the early evening. A witness to the stabbing said that the dispute arose among members of separate gangs at a nearby school yesterday and that members of the gang agreed to take the fight off school grounds.</p>
