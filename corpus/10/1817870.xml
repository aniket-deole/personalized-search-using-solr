        <p>''Cut and run'' versus ''stay the course'' is so 2006.</p>
        <p>This week has ushered in a new political battle over the language of the war: ''Surge,'' meet ''escalation.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats introduced the latter word to portray President Bush's expected proposal for a troop increase in Iraq in a negative light.</p>
        <p>''An escalation, whether it is called a surge or any other name, is still an escalation, and I believe it will be an immense new mistake,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Tuesday in a speech critiquing Mr. Bush's as-yet-unannounced Iraq plan.</p>
        <p>Should the significance of the word be lost on those too young to remember its loaded usage during the Vietnam War, Senator Kennedy added: ''The Department of Defense kept assuring us that each new escalation in Vietnam would be the last. Instead, each one led only to the next.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the new House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, used ''escalate'' or ''escalation'' six times during an interview on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.''</p>
        <p>Asked at his regular briefing on Tuesday about the Democrats' use of the ''E'' word, Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, initially said, ''I think a lot of times people are going to try to find a one-word characterization that allows them to make a political point without perhaps diving into the details.''</p>
        <p>But, pressed further by a reporter to address the new ''Democratic Party language,'' Mr. Snow said, ''Well, ask the guys who do their focus groups.''</p>
        <p>Finally, he said, given that President Bush would not announce his new plan until his speech on Wednesday night, ''It seems a little silly for me to start quibbling about adjectives without discussing what they purportedly describe, don't you think?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Snow last night said that the president would not be using the word ''surge'' in his speech, adding that it implied what he called a ''rush hour'' approach to a serious policy.</p>
