        <p>Four young men from Queens have been charged with trying to kill a man in Woodside on Friday because they suspected him of spraying graffiti on the house of one member of the group, prosecutors said yesterday. The four -- Ali Khan, 19, Aamer Khan, 18, Christian Diaz, 17, and Joseph Piazza, 18 -- are charged with attempted murder and assault, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said the group was riding in a Ford Explorer with the victim, Anthony Albaricci, 24, when one man looped a belt around Mr. Albaricci's neck and began strangling him. Another stabbed Mr. Albaricci, while one slashed him with a razor. Aamer Khan, who was driving, turned and tried to shoot him with a pistol, Mr. Brown said. The Explorer crashed and Mr. Albaricci fled, only to be chased and beaten with a wooden chair by two of the teenagers, Mr. Brown said, while the other two ran him down with the Explorer.</p>
