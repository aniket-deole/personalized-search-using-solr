        <p>Re ''The Invasion of the Alpha Male Democrat'' (Week in Review, Jan. 7):</p>
        <p>While Representative Rahm Emanuel and Senator Charles E. Schumer's recruitment of Alpha males has helped the Democratic Party gain some victories in the past election to control Congress, it's just another example of the cynical calculations Democrats have made to win elections at the cost of conviction.</p>
        <p>These calculations have led to politics that is overly accommodating to Republicans.</p>
        <p>Rather than focusing on tough-guy candidates, the Democrats should be tough about their convictions. Perhaps then they will become the Alpha party.</p>
