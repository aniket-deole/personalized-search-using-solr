        <p>A man convicted of killing a doctor who performed abortions as part of his practice apologized to the victim's widow in Federal District Court yesterday, the first day of his trial on charges of violating a federal law forbidding forceful interference with reproductive services. The man, James C. Kopp, 52, who is acting as his own lawyer, told Lynne Slepian, whose husband, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was killed by a rifle shot from woods outside their suburban home on the evening of Oct. 23, 1998, ''I respect you and your family.'' Mr. Kopp, who spent more than two years as a fugitive in Mexico and France, is serving a sentence of 25 years to life after his conviction on state murder charges. If convicted in federal court, he faces a possible sentence of life without parole.</p>
