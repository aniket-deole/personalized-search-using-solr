        <p>Introduced on Monday: 2008 Lexus IS-F</p>
        <p>Is it real? Oh, yes -- real enough to draw envious looks from the BMW M3 and the</p>
        <p>Audi RS4, high-performance sport sedans the Lexus will compete against.</p>
        <p>What's the point? The first car to wear Lexus' new high-performance ''F'' designation, the IS-F gets V-8 power and sharper handling in an effort to put the car on equal footing with European factory-tuner models.</p>
        <p>What they said: ''We think the IS was a really stout foundation, but it hasn't gotten the respect it could,'' said Paul Williamsen, production education manager of University of Toyota, the company's dealer-training arm.</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: The fastidious Lexus has always erred on the side of caution. But enthusiasts can rejoice: the IS will be among the first Lexus models to allow the stability control system to be shut off completely for full-bore performance driving.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? A 5.0-liter V-8 with 400-plus horsepower and the world's first</p>
        <p>eight-speed sport-shifting automatic will slingshot the IS to 60 m.p.h. in less than five seconds, Lexus says. The electric steering is retuned and the suspension is stiffened and lowered; this IS features custom 19-inch BBS wheels, enormous six-piston front brake calipers and a quartet of stacked exhaust outlets.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? The IS 350 can soar past $45,000 with options, so $55,000-$60,000 is a safe guess when the IS-F hits showrooms next January.</p>
        <p>How's it look? Like a street-fighting Japanese tuner. The show car features a delirious shade of blue that seemingly shouldn't survive outside a Petri dish.</p>
