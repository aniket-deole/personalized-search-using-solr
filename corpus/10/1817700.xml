        <p>BASSUK--Rose (nee Zellner) died peacefully January 3, at 92 years. Attitude is everything, she said, and do your best. This is how she lived. Hardships like polio didn't stop her. She connected with all kinds of people and impacted them with her zest, drive, thirst for learning, gracious speeches and letters. She modeled excelling to your potential. At a time when most finished the eighth grade, she earned two Masters degrees, was a teacher, librarian, wrote essays, and poems to Al, her dearly loved husband. Mom, Grandma, Rose--you were an inspiration especially to Al, your children Daniel, Brian, Glenn, Felice, their spouses Nancy, Pat, Rhoda, Adrienne, Barry, your seven grandchildren, five greatgrandchildren, and sister Blossom. We wish you peace and joy on your next journey. We'll be loving you...always.</p>
