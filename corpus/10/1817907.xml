        <p>A retired F.B.I. supervisor accused of aiding in Mafia murders is not immune from prosecution in state court, a Federal District Court judge ruled yesterday. The retired agent, R. Lindley DeVecchio, 66, was charged with four counts of murder last March in State Supreme Court. Prosecutors say Mr. DeVecchio, who was responsible for managing confidential informants, played a role in four killings between 1984 and 1992 by giving information to the Colombo crime family. In April, Mr. DeVecchio's lawyers sought to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the evidence was subject to federal grants of immunity and that his defense was based on federal law. But Judge Frederic Block ruled that Mr. DeVecchio had not presented a valid argument.</p>
