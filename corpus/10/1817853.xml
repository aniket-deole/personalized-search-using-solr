        <p>The Bowl Championship Series title game ended badly for the top-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on Monday, but it was a huge success for the Fox television network. According to Nielsen's time-zone-adjusted estimates, the football game dominated in every half-hour of the night, attracting 28.7 million viewers. Among adults 18 to 49, Fox posted its highest-rated Monday in three years. CBS ranked second for the night, aided by ''CSI: Miami'' at 10 (15.9 million) and its comedies in the 9 p.m. hour, ''Two and a Half Men'' (14.8 million) and ''The New Adventures of Old Christine'' (12.2 million). NBC was No. 2 in the 8 o'clock hour with ''Deal or No Deal'' (14 million), but its two repeats of ''Heroes'' finished last at 9 (5.7 million) and 10 (4.1 million). ABC's line-up of ''Wife Swap'' at 8 (8 million), ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.1 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (4.7 million) once again put the network in fourth place for the night in total viewers, but among adults 18 to 49, NBC lagged slightly behind it.</p>
