        <p>A faux documentary with a twist, ''Ever Since the World Ended'' unfolds in and around an eerily depopulated San Francisco 10 years after a mysterious plague has decimated humanity.

        <p>The result is a rudimentary yet fascinating record of remembrance and reconstruction, accessed through survivor interviews and carefully chosen landscapes. Effects are all the more special for being minimal: a decaying Golden Gate bridge, a decomposing ship listing in the harbor.</p>

        <p>A faux documentary with a twist, ''Ever Since the World Ended'' unfolds in and around an eerily depopulated San Francisco 10 years after a mysterious plague has decimated humanity. But instead of making a movie about the aftermath of a disaster, the filmmakers, Calum Grant and Joshua Atesh Litle, have tried something a little more clever and a lot cheaper: to envision what the first movie made after that disaster might look like.</p>
        <p>The result is a rudimentary yet fascinating record of remembrance and reconstruction, accessed through survivor interviews and carefully chosen landscapes. Effects are all the more special for being minimal: a decaying Golden Gate bridge, a decomposing ship listing in the harbor.</p>
        <p>The mood is gently melancholic, spiced with unexpected humor -- like the self-described ''last North American Indian'' who resents being everyone's spiritual backbone -- and the free-floating tension of a world without laws. At a cozy commune, bees are raised and children receive piano lessons while the adults wonder whether to kill a violent man recently returned to the city. The remnants of civilization are being preserved, albeit with a certain moral primitivism.</p>
        <p>Thought-provoking rather than deeply philosophical, ''Ever Since the World Ended'' features many engaging performances and several outstanding ones, including Mark Routhier as a damaged former emergency worker and David Driver as a self-justifying scavenger.</p>
        <p>What remains in the mind, however, is the film's atmospheric blend of hope and trepidation: the challenge and terror of a world with too much space and too few boundaries.</p>
        <p>Ever Since the World Ended  Opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Produced and directed by Calum Grant and Joshua Atesh Litle; written by Mr. Grant; director of photography, Mr. Litle; edited by David Driver and Mr. Litle; released by Cyan Pictures. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 78 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: James Curry (James), Linda Noveroske (Linda), Brad Olsen (Santosh) and Ronald Chase (Teacher).</p>
