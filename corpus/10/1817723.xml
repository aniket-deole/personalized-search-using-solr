She was raised on a farm in Kerhonkson, moved to Ellenville when she and Louis Resnick were married on February 7, 1943.

For 40 years Mildred and Lou were dedicated to the Ellenville Regional Hospital; they were there at the beginning and recently with their support, the hospital was able to break ground on the new state-of-the-art Emergency Department. As a gift for her 90th birthday, the Hospital Board honored her by naming the Women's Health Center after her. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations be made to the Mildred Resnick Women's Health Center, Ellenville Regional Hospital PO Box 688, Ellenville, NY 12428.</p>
        <p>$(6$)RESNICK--Mildred. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Mildred Resnick, beloved mother of Michele Cohen. The Cohen's deep commitment to the Jewish community and other humanitarian concerns is based on uncompromising standards of tzedakah. Such compassionate generosity places the highest value not on the giver, but on the overwhelming influence of the gift, making a profound impact on our ability to care for those in need. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Michele and Martin; to their children, and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. &amp; C.E.O.</p>
