        <p>OPENING SOON</p>
        <p>PANINO SPORTIVO -- This coffee and sandwich cafe with a soccer theme will open tomorrow. It is done in the red and black of the Italian soccer club A.C. Milan and is a branch of the original cafe in Morningside Heights: 26 Prince Street (Mott Street), (212) 431-0800.</p>
        <p>RETSINA -- This traditional Greek spot is owned by Yannis Hatjopoulos and his wife, Katerina. They expect to start serving meze, individual casseroles of moussaka and baklava, by Monday. The consulting chef, Thomas Xanthopoulos, was formerly at Periyali: 115 East 60th Street; (212) 486-8826.</p>
        <p>OPEN NOW</p>
        <p>JOSIE'S KITCHEN -- Louis Lanza has opened a third branch of his Josie's chain, which features dishes made with organic ingredients. The décor uses recycled materials: 1614 Second Avenue (84th Street), (212) 734-6644.</p>
        <p>LOOKING AHEAD</p>
        <p>SECOND AVENUE DELI -- If Jeremy and Josh Lebewohl have their way, this iconic deli will reopen in Midtown in the summer. The original, which was run by the brothers' father, Jack, and their uncle Abe, who was murdered in 1996, closed a year ago. Like Madison Square Garden, the restaurant will keep its original name, without reflecting its new location. The building, which the brothers hope to buy, is between Third and Lexington Avenues: 162 East 33rd Street.</p>
        <p>KEFI -- Michael Psilakis will close Onera tomorrow and reopen it on Monday with this new name, which is a Greek term meaning high spirits. The décor will be dressed down and the menu will be more rustic, with regional dishes, casseroles and cheaper prices ($14.95 maximum; no credit cards): 222 West 79th Street, (212) 873-0200.</p>
        <p>Mr. Psilakis also plans to open Anthos, with Greek haute cuisine in an elegant setting, at 36 West 52nd Street. It will replace Acqua Pazza, which will close after dinner on Valentine's Day. Donatella Arpaia, Mr. Psilakis's partner in Dona, which just closed, will be his partner in both restaurants.</p>
        <p>CHANGING HANDS</p>
        <p>LE JULES VERNE -- This restaurant opened in 1983 on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower. It is owned by the city of Paris and will now be run by Alain Ducasse. He has a nine-year contract in partnership with L'Affiche, a subsidiary of Sodexho, an international food service company. Mr. Ducasse plans to close the restaurant this summer for a month or more, to refurbish it. He has not decided on a chef. Sodexho will run Altitude 95 (named for its height in meters above sea level) on the first floor of the tower, in cooperation with Mr. Ducasse: Eiffel Tower, 011-33-1-45-55-20-04.</p>
        <p>CHEFS ON THE MOVE</p>
        <p>TYSON WONG OPHASO is no longer the executive chef at Chinatown Brasserie in NoLIta. Joe Ng, the dim sum chef, will take on his duties.</p>
        <p>Bill PEET is the new chef at Patroon in Midtown. He replaces Craig Atwood.</p>
        <p>CLOSED</p>
        <p>ATELIER -- This restaurant on Central Park South will become BLT Market.</p>

        <p>Panino Sportivo, a cafe with a soccer theme, comes to SoHo, a third branch of Josie’s Kitchen opens on the Upper East Side and, in Paris, Le Jules Verne changes hands.</p>
