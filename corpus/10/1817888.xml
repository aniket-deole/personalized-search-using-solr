        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a marketer who managed three of the brands featured in your article on packaging, I must take issue with your negative description of these packages, the companies and their founders as ''spin.''</p>
        <p>The Cascadian Farm image you mention isn't a marketer's fancy; it's an accurate, if artistic, representation of that company's ''home farm,'' the true place where the company started more than three decades ago. Cascadian's founder, Gene Kahn, helped create the Washington State organic program, served as a member of the National Organic Standards Board and co-founded an organic research institute. Spin? I think not.</p>
        <p>Annie Bennett, the founder of My Family Farm, is indeed a social worker, founded organizations to help abused children and donates a great deal of her life and personal finances to the cause of benefiting the lives of children. Spin? I think not.</p>
        <p>You may choose to describe these products, companies and founders as ''greenwashing,'' but I prefer the word ''inspirational.''</p>

        <p>The writer is senior vice president of marketing for Aurora Organic Dairy.</p>
