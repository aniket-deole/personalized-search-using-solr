        <p>The biggest individual donor in 2006 was Bob J. Perry, a conservative Texas homebuilder, who kicked in almost $10 million to use against Democratic candidates for Congress.</p>
        <p>George Soros, the billionaire financier, spent $3.4 million to help elect Democrats in 2006; two years earlier, he gave $23.4 million in hope of defeating President Bush.</p>
