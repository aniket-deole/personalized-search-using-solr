        <p>New Jersey's state medical school may have improperly billed Medicaid for helicopter ambulance flights, according to a report released yesterday by a federal monitor. A former judge, Herbert J. Stern, who was appointed a year ago to investigate financial irregularities at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, noted in the report that the school had made many policy and personnel changes to address widespread problems with overbilling, nepotism and wasteful spending. But the report said that the university's hospital in Newark might lack proper certification for its air ambulance program. Anna Farneski, a school spokeswoman, said that university officials were reviewing the certification with the state police, who also participate, to ensure that the school complied with federal regulations.</p>
