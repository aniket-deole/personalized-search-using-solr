        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''So Now You're What Your Children Eat?''(Jan. 9): Did the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention really believe a full-blown study was necessary to learn that adults who live with children eat more fat, including saturated fat?</p>
        <p>Even the C.D.C.'s researchers with kids could have explained how the contents of one's refrigerator changes when children are also being fed, and whatever food is in the house gets consumed by adults and children alike. Fish sticks, chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese and graham crackers, just to name a few, seem to wend their way into everyone's diet to varying degrees.</p>

        <p>Also, it may not just be about the foods you eat but the amounts of food. Pity the parent who has two seatings a night -- the early dinner with the kids, and the second dinner with the spouse a few hours later.</p>
