        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''2 Miles in Newark That Run From Long Decline to Rebirth'' (''The Hard Part'' series, front page, Jan. 5), about the prospects for economic redevelopment in Newark:</p>
        <p>You note that ''the public school system is in shambles'' and that any new businesses Mayor Cory A. Booker may bring in ''will find a largely unskilled work force.'' What is the evidence for such an extreme characterization of Newark's schools?</p>
        <p>Surely they are seriously challenged, and everyone should want them to perform better. But the reality is that in recent years, the public schools in Newark have made modest improvements in attendance and graduation rates, achieved higher scores on statewide tests in the elementary grades, and upgraded teacher training programs.</p>
        <p>Is it impossible for outsiders to accept that the Newark schools can improve? Or is it that the voucher advocates and state officials who want to cut education spending have an interest in promoting the notion that no change is possible?</p>
        <p>Your negative characterization of the public schools in Newark is unfair and makes the road to improvement even more difficult.</p>
        <p>Robert Curvin  Newark, Jan. 5, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is an urban policy consultant.</p>
