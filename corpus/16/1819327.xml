        <p>Two men fleeing a shootout with the police were critically injured yesterday when their car crashed into an S.U.V., the authorities said. The men, whose names were not immediately released, were part of a group caught stripping a car on 12th Avenue about 8 a.m., the police said. As officers approached, most of the group scattered, but the two men got into an Acura Legend and began to back up toward the officers, said Todd McClendon, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department. Two officers opened fire on the car. The Acura sped off and crashed into a Ford Explorer several blocks away. The men were reported in critical condition at University Hospital. Charges against them were pending, the police said.</p>
