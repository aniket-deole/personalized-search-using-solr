        <p>VOSE--Elliott Evans, of New York City and Quogue, New York, died on Saturday January 13th of pneumonia. He was born in Boston, Massachusets on November 30th, 1923, the son of the late Winifred Elliott Vose and Zelman Evans Vose. He was a graduate of Phillips Academy Andover 1942, Yale College 1945w and the Yale Law School 1950. After practicing law at Winthrop, Stimpson, Putnam and Roberts he joined the Singer Corporation and later the Grumman Corporation where he retired as a Senior Vice President. He served as President of the Quogue Field Club and the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Southampton, New York. He was a former Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Southampton Hospital. He is survived by his wife Ann Cogswell Vose and three step daughters, Esme Murphy Klopp, Aleta Murphy Gleason, and Nona Murphy Collin, and five grandchildren Eugenie and Francis Gleason, Katherine Elliott Collin, and Harrison and Esme Klopp. Funeral Service will be private. A memorial service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers the family would be grateful for contributions sent in Elliott's memory to the Southampton Hospital Foundation, 240 Meeting House Lane, Southampton, NY 11968, or a charity of one's choice.</p>
