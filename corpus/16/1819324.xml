        <p>A 33-year-old man has been accused of stealing car keys from patrons at Nassau County gyms, then stealing wallets and purses from their cars, the Nassau County police said yesterday. The police said the man, Sean A. Gluck, would take a set of keys from a locker room, then would find the car that matched the key using the horn feature on the remote lock button. Mr. Gluck would use the credit and debit cards he found in the cars to buy American Express Gift Cards and go shopping with those, the police said. He was arrested on Sunday and has been charged with seven counts of identity theft, as well as larceny, forgery and possessing stolen property.</p>
