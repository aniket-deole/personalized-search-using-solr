        <p>A 58-year-old subway rider died early yesterday when he fell to the tracks beneath a moving No. 6 train just south of Brooklyn Bridge station, the police said. The man, Jose Montanez, of Brooklyn, was standing between two cars, urinating, when the train began to loop around, having come to the last stop on the line, the police said. During the tight turn, Mr. Montanez's head was pinched between the ends of the cars and he was thrown to the tracks, the police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
