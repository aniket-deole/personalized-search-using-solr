        <p>Ryan Hall ran the longest race of his career Sunday in the national half-marathon championship in Houston, setting an American record of 59 minutes 43 seconds. In a conference call yesterday from his home in Big Bear Lake, Calif., he said he planned to run his first marathon, perhaps in Boston in the spring.</p>
        <p>Hall, a 23-year-old Stanford graduate, said he was running 100 miles a week in training and hoped to raise that to 120 or 130. His plans include two races in Central Park in New York: the national 8-kilometer championship March 17 and the Olympic marathon trials Nov. 3. He may be a spectator at the Feb. 2 Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, where his wife, Sara, will run in the 3,000 meters.</p>
