        <p>Carjackers who abducted a 29-year-old woman in her S.U.V. yesterday apparently changed their minds after her husband called to tell her that the police had been notified, the authorities said. The woman, visiting with her husband from out of state, had been waiting for him in a rented 2006 Chevrolet Equinox outside an apartment building on Park Place in Crown Heights at 2:45 a.m. when two strangers climbed in, pushed her into the passenger seat and drove off, the police said. The husband, who saw the men jump in, called 911, then called his wife on her cellphone, the police said. Apparently, the carjackers overheard him tell her that the police were on their way. They pulled over and fled on foot, taking only a wallet, the police said.</p>
