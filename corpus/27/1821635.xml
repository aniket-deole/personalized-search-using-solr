        <p>KLINGENSTEIN--Richard Sheridan, (''Klingy'' to his many friends), age 61, died peacefully at home on Saturday January 19, 2008 after a short illness. Devoted father of Christopher (Nikki), former husband of Ann Holmes, loving brother of Jean and Bill (Fran), fond uncle of Stacy and John, cherished friend of Sue Christiansen and Pat Crofts, ''Klingy'' will be sorely missed. Born in New York City November 27, 1946 to Carroll and Percy Klingenstein, ''Klingy'' grew up in Manhattan, graduated from the Gunnery School in Washington, CT and the University of Denver. Following his honorable discharge from the United States Air Force in 1972 he moved to Denver. Active member of the University Club of Denver, Valley Country Club, Crestmoor Community Association, Colorado Senior Golfers' Association, Western Stock Show Association, the Good Ol' Boys, Sam's Club and Costco, ''Klingy'' has been a staunch and generous supporter of many cultural, community and charitable organizations. A memorial service was held on Wednesday, January 23 at 11am in Denver. Contributions may be made to Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (at www.pancan.org or by phone at 877-272-6226) or to a charity of your choice.</p>
