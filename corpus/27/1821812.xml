        <p>''CSI,'' on CBS, came within a half million viewers of ABC's ''Grey's Anatomy'' on Thursday night at 9. According to Nielsen's estimates, ''CSI'' drew just under 21 million viewers, to 21.4 million for ''Grey's Anatomy.'' CBS finished No. 1 for the night in total viewers, but ABC dominated among adults 18 to 49. At 8, a rebroadcast of CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (12.4 million) finished first ahead of ABC's ''Ugly Betty'' (9.8 million), which posted its best ratings for a rerun. A rerun of CBS's ''Shark'' (14 million) led at 10 in total viewers, while ABC's ''Men in Trees'' (11 million) edged it out among adults 18 to 49, posting a series high in that demographic. NBC was third for the night with a lineup of comedy reruns from 8 to 11. ''My Name Is Earl'' at 8 (8.4 million) and ''The Office'' at 8:30 (7.8 million), led at 8 among adults 18 to 49.</p>
