        <p>There has been a continuing battle over the producer credit for ''The Departed,'' the film directed by Martin Scorsese that was just nominated for a best-picture Oscar. Brad Grey, the head of Paramount Studios, argued that he deserved credit for his role in putting the film together, but the producers' branch of the academy, which decides who can accept the Oscar as the producer of the best-picture winner, determined on Thursday night that only Graham King was eligible. The same group decided that of the five people who have received credit for producing ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' another best-picture contender, only David T. Friendly, Peter Saraf and Marc Turtletaub can come to the stage to pick up the award should the film win. The Academy Awards will take place on Feb. 25.
