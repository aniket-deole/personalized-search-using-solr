        <p>COYLE--Daniel Edward. We mourn the loss of our beloved father who died the morning of January 19, 2008 after a long illness. He lived 88 wonderful years. Beloved husband of the late Eileen Jane (Tuohy) Coyle. Beloved father of Dr. Patricia K Coyle, Daniel E Coyle II, Claudia Coyle, Mary Jane Herkenham, Christopher Coyle, and Eileen D Flood. Beloved grandfather of Daniel E III, Mackenzie, Peter, Eileen, Laura, Katie, Kira, Shannon, and Billy. Beloved brother of the late Jack, Kathleen, and Edward. Beloved brother of Veronica. Beloved son of the late John Coyle and Mary Britton. Attended Catholic University, served in the Navy in WWII, and was a Church Street Postal Supervisor for many years before retirement. Our hearts are broken. We will miss you terribly. What you showed us in this last year was that you were the strongest, most courageous, and noble man we have ever known . You are our inspiration, and will live on in our memories until we see you again.</p>
