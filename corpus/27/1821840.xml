        <p>One construction worker was killed and another injured when a one-story brick building collapsed in Nashville, the police said. The workers -- Richard Whiteshield, 57, of Clewiston, Fla., who was killed, and John Kemper of Hendersonville, Tenn., who was injured -- were part of a crew that was using a jackhammer to dig up a gas main to the building, which was being demolished, said Kristin Mumford, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department. The building, in the city's Berry Hill neighborhood, had been closed for some time, said Kim Lawson, the deputy fire chief.</p>
