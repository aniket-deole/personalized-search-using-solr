        <p>Web site GetCrafty.com offers patterns and tips, and organization Church of Craft offers knitters and needleworkers place to socialize and swap patterns; several books on subject, such as Stitch 'n Bitch by Debbie Stoller and Get Crafty: Hip Home Ec by Jean Railla have found success (M)</p>

        <p>In 2000 the GetCrafty.com Web site offered a pattern for a crocheted skull (not for the faint of heart, or needle), recasting traditional ''women's work'' for the post-riotgrrrl era. That same year groups of women and the occasional sensitive guy began gathering on Sundays to swap ideas and patterns in an organization called the Church of Craft.</p>
        <p>Though needlework as politics may be new in the museum setting, in recent years ''making things by hand has come back in a big way among younger people,'' said Debbie Stoller, the author of a best-selling series of books, ''Stitch 'n Bitch,'' which extols the virtues of craft circles, and the editor of Bust magazine. ''For a lot of people, it's a way of rebelling against a larger consumer culture. You know where it's made, and you know what goes into making it.''</p>

        <p>In 2000 the GetCrafty.com Web site offered a pattern for a crocheted skull (not for the faint of heart, or needle), recasting traditional ''women's work'' for the post-riotgrrrl era. That same year groups of women and the occasional sensitive guy began gathering on Sundays to swap ideas and patterns in an organization called the Church of Craft.</p>
        <p>Though needlework as politics may be new in the museum setting, in recent years ''making things by hand has come back in a big way among younger people,'' said Debbie Stoller, the author of a best-selling series of books, ''Stitch 'n Bitch,'' which extols the virtues of craft circles, and the editor of Bust magazine. ''For a lot of people, it's a way of rebelling against a larger consumer culture. You know where it's made, and you know what goes into making it.''</p>
        <p>Jean Railla, the author of ''Get Crafty: Hip Home Ec'' (Broadway Books, 2004) and founder of GetCrafty.com, agreed: ''In a world of thousand-dollar 'it' bags, and hyperconsumerism, one of the most political things you can do is to make something yourself.''</p>
        <p>Her site, which went online in 1997, is largely credited with inspiring the movement that turned ''handmade'' into bohemian chic, and propelling a formerly fusty hobby into a $30 billion business.</p>
        <p>The Church of Craft now has outposts in nine cities, and the Museum of Arts and Design will most likely be overrun with its yarn-toting acolytes, primed for the idea that craft is the height of creativity.</p>
        <p>Still, sometimes a spool is just a spool. ''I think it's awesome that people are using needlecraft as a medium,'' Ms. Stoller said. ''It has a lot of associations, from the cheesy to the feminist. But I don't think every single scarf needs to be elevated to art.''</p>
