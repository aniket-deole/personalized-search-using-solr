        <p>SMITH--Marie Francoise (nee Saunier). Beloved wife of Raymond Christopher Smith of New York City and dear mother of Constance of New York City and Paris, and Christopher and Corin of New York City. Marie passed away on January 16th, 2008, peacefully at her Manhattan home with her family by her side. She is lovingly remembered by her mother, Francoise Saunier, her sisters Chantal, Brigitte, Catherine and Veronique, and her brother Philippe. A wonderful mother and loving wife, Marie set a marvelous example to those around her, both friends and family, with her philanthropic nature and extreme loyalty to those close to her. No matter where she lived-France, New York, Islamorada or Toronto-she was at home everywhere. She will be dearly missed by her family and friends on both sides of the ocean. ''How lucky we have been to have danced to Life's eternal music'', and now Marie is at rest and will write the music to which her loved ones will dance. On January 16th, mass was said in her honour at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, and an intimate service was held on January 18th at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Chelsea, conducted by Rev. Gerald Murray. A service will be held in France on January 26th. The family would like to thank Dr. Mark Kris and his committed and caring team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering.</p>
