        <p>LIBOWITZ--Shirley Marcus, 83, was a loving wife, mother and grandmother who made friends easily. A New Yorker who moved to La Jolla, CA, almost 13 years ago. She died there in a rehab center on January 18th, 2008. She had bravely overcome many medical traumas and was making an impressive adjustment to Alzheimer's disease. Shirley was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Washington Square College at NYU and won medals in a number of fields. She received a Master's degree in social work at Columbia University and worked in that field a number of years. She was an outstanding classical pianist. For over 10 years she attended what is now called the Osher Institute for Lifelong Learning at UCSD. For a few years there she taught a highly regarded course, ''The Novel''. Shirley is survived by her husband of 52 years, Dr. Justus (Judd) Libowitz; brother Richard Marcus and wife Helen of Boca Raton, FL; daughters Nancy Smith of Indianapolis, IN, and Claudia Libowitz of Dobbs Ferry, NY; grandchildren Danny, Jamie, Jeffrey and Julia; a nephew and niece, Stuart and Gwen Marcus of NYC. Family and friends will sorely miss Shirley, but will cherish their memories of her.</p>
