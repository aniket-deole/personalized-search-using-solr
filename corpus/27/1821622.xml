        <p>EAGLETON--George D. George D. Eagleton of Santa Barbara, CA, passed on peacefully after a brief illness Saturday, January 12, 2008. Born in Peoria, IL, to Lee O. Eagleton and Virginia Mackemer Eagleton, he graduated from Northwestern University in 1955 and served in the U.S. Naval Reserve, retiring as a Lieutenant. In 1973 he joined the Northern Trust Bank in Chicago, and in 1987 he relocated to the newly opened branch in Santa Barbara as a Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager. George received the Best Performance award for the NT's Western Region in 1993 and again in 1994, and when he retired in 1996, he received accolades for anticipating the stock market falls in 1973 and 1987. A co-worker remembered him as a truly good colleague, mentor, and friend, generous with his time and judicious in his influence. He since predicted the unprecedented rise in the price of gold. George served on numerous Boards of Directors including Planned Parenthood and the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and he supported local and national charities. His retirement years were rich and filled with travel. He lived as a gentleman, without fear, and with a twinkle in his eye. George is survived by his beloved wife, Jane Hewitt Eagleton; his devoted daughter Gwen; his sister-in-law and two nephews; six step-children; five grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. Contributions may be made to the George Eagleton Memorial Fund at Planned Parenthood on-line at www.ppsbvslo.org.</p>
