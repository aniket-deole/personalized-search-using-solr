        <p>SNIDER--Clara Fox. December 2, 1910 -January 25, 2007. Beloved wife of the late Silas Snider, mother of Amy and Jenny, grandmother of Ivy, great-grandmother of Lily, and aunt of Alan, Carol, and Joan. She was a deeply caring and generous person; a woman of intelligence; an early feminist who remained committed to a progressive political view of the world. She especially loved music, poetry and the movies. Her last and happiest years were spent at the Isabella Residence in Manhattan with her beloved cat, Rosie, where she became an enthusiastic student of painting, pottery and games of chance. Memorial Services will be held at the Plaza Jewish Community Chapel on Sunday, January 28th at 10am.</p>
