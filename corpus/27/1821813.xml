        <p>Doomed Romance</p>
        <p>The creators of ''Les Misérables,'' ''Miss Saigon'' and ''The Pirate Queen'' will join with the composer Michel Legrand on their next musical, Playbill.com reported. Alain Boublil, Claude-Michel Schönberg and Mr. Legrand will collaborate on ''Marguerite,'' a musical based on ''La Dame aux Camélias,'' the play by the younger Alexandre Dumas that became the basis of Verdi's ''Traviata'' and ''Camille,'' the 1936 movie starring Greta Garbo. ''Marguerite,'' as their version of the story of a courtesan who falls for a younger man is called, is scheduled to open in London in 2008.</p>

        <p>A 10-year-old boy who directed a short film, starring Kevin Bacon, about an injured stray dog, is suing the woman who helped finance it, The Associated Press reported. Dominic Scott Kay, right, who was the voice of Wilbur the pig in ''Charlotte's Web,'' claimed in a lawsuit filed on Thursday in Los Angeles that Conroy Kanter, who invested about $11,000 in ''Saving Angelo,'' demanded creative control and the right to decide where the film could be shown. Ms. Kanter's lawyer said the money was a charitable contribution and that the lawsuit stemmed from a dispute between Ms. Kanter and Dominic's mother over who should benefit from the film. The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and a declaration that Ms. Kanter has no rights over the film or its distribution.</p>

        <p>B. B. King, the 81-year-old bluesman, was hospitalized in Galveston, Tex., with flulike symptoms on Thursday night but was expected to be released over the weekend. Jennifer Lopez will release her first Spanish-language album, ''Como Ama Una Mujer'' (''How a Woman Loves''), in April. Nicole Kidman and seven others suffered minor injuries on a Los Angeles movie set early on Thursday when her car crashed during filming of ''The Invasion.''</p>
