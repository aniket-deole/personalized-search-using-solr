        <p>Farmers and ranchers in storm-plagued areas of southeastern Colorado who lost livestock in recent back-to-back blizzards will be able to obtain low-interest emergency loans of up to $500,000 from the United States Agriculture Department, federal officials said. As many as 10,000 head of cattle may have been killed by the storms, but the final count remains uncertain because many animals remain buried in snow. Losses are also mounting from the deaths of weakened animals. President Bush signed a declaration this month qualifying parts of Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska for federal disaster relief.</p>
