        <p>The General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the denial of the Holocaust, with only Iran, which was the host to a conference last month that cast doubt on the existence of the Holocaust, disassociating itself from the measure, which was drafted by the United States, co-sponsored by 103 countries and agreed to by consensus. Hossein Gharibi, the delegate from Iran, said that Israel exploited the sufferings of Jews as a cover ''to commit new genocide and crimes'' against the Palestinians. Dan Gillerman, the ambassador of Israel, responded, ''While the nations of the world gather here to affirm the historicity of the Holocaust with the intent of never again allowing genocide, a member of the Assembly is acquiring the capabilities of carrying out its own.''</p>
