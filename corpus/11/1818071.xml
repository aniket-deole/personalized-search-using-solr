        <p>For the music industry, last week was especially sleepy, and that's not good. The top-selling album, the ''Dreamgirls'' soundtrack (Sony), beat the record -- established six months ago -- for the lowest sales of a No. 1 album since SoundScan began tracking music sales in 1991. In a week that had no major new releases, ''Dreamgirls'' sold 66,000 copies, and the No. 2 album on the Billboard chart, Akon's ''Konvicted'' (Universal), moved 64,000. Chris Daughtry's ''Daughtry'' (RCA) is No. 3; Justin Timberlake's ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' (Jive) is No. 4; and Vol. 23 of ''Now That's What I Call Music!'' is No. 5. Every title in the Top 10 had a sales decline of at least 27 percent over the week before, and the total number of album sales in the United States in the week that ended Sunday was 22 percent less than in the same week last year.</p>
