        <p>A man who works at an organization that collaborates with a school in Brooklyn was charged yesterday with sexually assaulting a teenage student, city school officials said. The man, Ivory Gordon, 24, of Brooklyn, was charged with rape, sex abuse and criminal sexual conduct, according to the office of Richard J. Condon, the special commissioner of investigation for the city schools. The student, a girl attending the New Beginnings School, was assaulted several times on school premises and at Mr. Gordon's home, according to Mr. Condon's office. Mr. Gordon was suspended without pay on Monday from his job as a case manager at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club's Navy Yard clubhouse, said Joseph Patuleia, the organization's executive director.
