        <p>Many digital cameras shoot rudimentary video, and some camcorders take a shot at producing passable photographs. The Canon DC50 tries to do both well. Its five-megapixel sensor is equal in resolution to that of some midgrade cameras, and is actually bigger than those used by some photojournalists just a year or so ago.</p>
        <p>Canon's road map for the future of imaging foresees a merging of video and still photography, with one sensor and one chipset to satisfy both needs, and the DC50 is a step in that direction. A new processing chip, the Digic DV II, handles both kinds of images.</p>

        <p>The DC50, which will be available at the end of next month for about $799, has both a built-in flash and video light. It can record still and moving images simultaneously onto three-inch DVDs, including dual-layer ones for added capacity, and a MiniSD-size camera card.</p>
        <p>The camera's 10x lens zooms out to a serious telephoto length, 447 millimeters in still-camera terms. An image stabilization mechanism can be turned on to prevent shaky snapshots at this high magnification.</p>
