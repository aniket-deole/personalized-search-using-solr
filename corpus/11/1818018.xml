        <p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Wednesday that he was in pain. A lot of pain.</p>
        <p>And, he conceded, he has passed on his woes to his wife, Maria Shriver.</p>
        <p>The governor, who rolled out his annual budget to the state house press corps here, broke his right leg skiing just before Christmas. He has hobbled on crutches, meandering rather than his more accustomed strutting, through the daily business of government.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I can remember having this much pain,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said at a budget presentation that in contrast to his physical condition seemed strong.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said that California, which has experienced treacherous budget shortfalls in recent years, faced a gross operating deficit of $1.8 billion this year, but that prepaying state debt and some complex fiscal maneuvers would allow it to enjoy a modest surplus in the next fiscal year.</p>
        <p>''You heard me right,'' he said, panting slightly after making his way to the lectern in the auditorium of the building housing the office of the secretary of state. The governor has proposed cuts for agencies and restructuring the welfare-to-work system, to save more than an estimated $300 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarzenegger conceded that he chafed at his hampered mobility. He chose to present his health care address, the centerpiece of his second-term agenda, by satellite from Los Angeles on Monday rather than before a live audience here.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing I hate more than having an obstacle,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His injury occurred at ''a very slow speed,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said, meaning that his ski did not pop off. As a result, the break occurred where the femur meets the hip, which he said was an artificial one.</p>
