He joined Manhattan College as Assistant Professor of Theology in 1959 and later became Academic Vice President, Executive Vice President and Provost, and in 1975 was named President, a position he held for 12 years. A champion of Catholic higher eduction, he was dedicated to establishing new programs, which enhanced the College's academic landscape.
