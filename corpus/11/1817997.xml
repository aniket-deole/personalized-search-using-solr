        <p>The notion of a computer at the heart of every home gets a little bump with the multitasking Hewlett-Packard TouchSmart PC, unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show this week as part of the introduction of the Windows Vista operating system from Microsoft.</p>
        <p>The TouchSmart, which will cost $1,800 when it goes on sale at the end of the month, has a 19-inch touch-sensitive screen intended to serve as a family bulletin board, with virtual sticky notes written with a finger or stylus -- or even left by voice, in a recorded memo.</p>
        <p>This computer is also a high-definition TV, and can play FM radio or stored music through screen-side speakers, or external ones for a home-theater effect. Designed as a wire- and clutter-free stand-alone device, it connects to the world via Wi-Fi and further contains its footprint with a wireless keyboard, mouse and remote control.</p>
        <p>The TouchSmart's designers envision a user's walking up to it on a kitchen counter, checking e-mail, appointments and weather, leaving family reminders and maybe watching the first 30 seconds of the evening news before dashing out.</p>
