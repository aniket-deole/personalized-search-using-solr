        <p>VLADECK--Judith P. Died in NYC on January 8th. A pioneering advocate for the rights of women, minorities, older workers, and all working people.

Vladeck, a distinguished labor lawyer and founder of the firm. She is survived by her daughter and law partner Anne Vladeck, her sons Bruce of NYC, and David of Washington D.C., her daughters-in-law Fredda Vladeck, and Mary Pendergast, and five grandchildren: Elizabeth, Stephen, Abigail, Joseph, and Thomas Vladeck. A memorial service will be scheduled in the near future.</p>

We extend our condolences to her sons Bruce and David, to her daughter Anne, and to their families. We will miss her raspy voice, her sage counsel and her unassuming dignity. Barnett Zumoff MD, President Samuel Norich, Executive Director</p>
