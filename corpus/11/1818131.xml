        <p>A New Jersey man accused of being involved in a robbery attempt at an Inwood home in which a 9-year-old boy was shot through the eye has been arrested, the Nassau County police said yesterday. The man, Raseed Watson, 21, of Paterson, N.J., was extradited to Nassau County on Tuesday and arraigned yesterday on one count of first-degree robbery, the police said. The police said they believed that Mr. Watson fired the shot that injured the boy, John Henry Romano Jr., now 10, and expected to file additional charges against him. Investigators said Mr. Watson was one of three men who entered the Inwood home in September and engaged in a gunfight with the owner. A 22-year-old Brooklyn man was arrested in the case in October, and a third suspect remains at large, the police said.</p>
