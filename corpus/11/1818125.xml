        <p>David Beckham's future, at Real Madrid or beyond, should become clear today when his representatives meet with officials from Real Madrid to discuss its two-year contract offer.</p>
        <p>''There is a significant offer on the table from Real Madrid and we are meeting with them tomorrow to feedback on their proposal,'' Simon Oliveira, Beckham's agent, said in an e-mail message. ''After that meeting, there will be further clarification on David's contract situation.''</p>
        <p>According to the terms of his current contract, Beckham is free to discuss a new deal with any club in the world. Oliveira last week told the BBC that Beckham would not transfer to another team this month, but could leave Real Madrid on a free transfer in June.</p>
        <p>It has long been speculated that Beckham would jump to Major League Soccer and play in Los Angeles for the Galaxy. Beckham's representatives and Real Madrid officials spent yesterday trying to defuse comments made by Predrag Mijatovic, the club's sporting director. On Tuesday he said that ''Beckham will leave us; we will not renew his contract.''</p>
