        <p>MOORE--John McDonald. January 11, 1919 -September 14 ,1999. How shall I withhold my soul so that it does not touch on yours? How shall I uplifted over you to other things? Ah, willing would I by some lost thing in the dark give it harbor in an unfamiliar silent place that does not vibrate on when your depths vibrate. Yet everything that touches us, you and me, takes us together as a bow's stroke does, that out of two strings draws a single voice. Upon what instrument are we two spanned? And what player has us in his hand? O sweet song. R.M. Rilke</p>
