        <p>A double-header of ''House'' made Fox the ratings victor on Tuesday. According to Nielsen's estimates, the 9 p.m. episode, in which Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) managed to save himself from jail time, was the highest-rated show of the night, drawing 17.8 million viewers. It followed an 8 p.m. repeat of ''House'' (9 million), which also ranked first in its time slot among adults 18 to 49, even as a rerun of CBS's ''NCIS'' at 8 outdrew it in total viewers (12.8 million). NBC led the 10 p.m. hour with ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' (14.5 million) and edged out CBS for second place for the night. NBC earned modest ratings successes earlier in the night with ''Dateline'' at 8 (9.6 million) and ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' at 9 (11.9 million). From 9 to 11, CBS's coverage of the 33rd Annual People's Choice Awards, with Queen Latifah as host, drew 11.3 million viewers, a slight increase from the show's ratings a year ago. ABC was fourth for the night as ''Big Day'' continued to garner small audiences at 9 (4.4 million) and 9:30 (4 million).</p>
