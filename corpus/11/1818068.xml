        <p>Yesterday, Jan. 10, a date that will live in meteorological history, snow flurries were glimpsed in Central Park for the first time this winter.</p>
        <p>The previous record for the latest recorded snowfall was Jan. 4, 1878, when President Rutherford B. Hayes discussed with his Cabinet the possible minting of silver dollars.</p>
        <p>The first snow yesterday, a chilly, blustery day, follows a period of unusual warmth throughout the Northeast and especially in New York City. A shift in the jet stream, which carries frigid air from the Arctic Circle, appears to have spared the region the usual winter storms so far, meteorologists say.</p>
        <p>For the record, flurries fell in the park at 9:55 a.m., when the temperature was 33 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. It was over in less than 15 minutes. New Jersey got more snow, with Newark Liberty International Airport reporting a total of 0.1 inch.</p>
        <p>Brian Ciemnecki, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's station in Upton, on Long Island, said, ''You can still get snow flurries at 33, even 34 and 35 degrees.''</p>
        <p>No snow is in the forecast, until perhaps Tuesday, he said.</p>
        <p>Were there any instances yesterday of toddlers sticking their tongues out and letting snow flakes melt?</p>
        <p>''Not that I know of,'' he said.</p>
