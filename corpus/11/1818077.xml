      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Saturday about a controversy over a national sweepstakes awarding a $25,000 savings bond to the first American baby born in 2007 gave an erroneous birth weight in some copies for a Chinese-American girl, born in Manhattan, who was disqualified because her mother was not a legal resident. The girl, Yuki Lin, weighed 6.5 pounds, not 6.5 ounces. (The sponsor of the sweepstakes, Toys ''R'' Us, has since reversed its decision and awarded Yuki and two other babies born shortly after midnight $25,000 each.)</p>
