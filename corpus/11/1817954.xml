        <p>YOUR wineglass is filled, and you are about to cut into the confit de canard. Whatever you do, don't say, ''Bon appétit'' to your French hosts.</p>
        <p>''In France, 'Bon appétit' is not proper,'' said Marie de Tilly, right, who teaches etiquette here. ''When people use it, it sounds just like an invitation for a good digestion and suggests that you are so hungry that you may jump on any food that would cross your mouth.''</p>

        <p>YOUR wineglass is filled, and you are about to cut into the confit de canard. Whatever you do, don't say, ''Bon appétit'' to your French hosts.</p>
        <p>''In France, 'Bon appétit' is not proper,'' said Marie de Tilly, right, who teaches etiquette here. ''When people use it, it sounds just like an invitation for a good digestion and suggests that you are so hungry that you may jump on any food that would cross your mouth.''</p>
        <p>The rule is rooted in 19th-century beliefs that anything suggesting the body or bodily functions is improper conversation for the dinner table. It was part of a host of other meal-time rules driven home in an explosion of essays about ''Savoir-vivre à la française'' in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>''Guests would never touch food with their hands and would only shell shrimps with a knife and a fork,'' said Frédéric Rouvillois, the author of a book on the history of politeness in France. The hostess ''was never congratulated for the dinner she held.'' Talking about food was a taboo. ''It was considered materialistic,'' Mr. Rouvillois said.</p>
        <p>The age, he said, was one ''when people tended to be more interested in intellectual, even idealistic issues.'' He added, ''We kept the ban of bon appétit from that time.''</p>
        <p>But not all of the French are aware of the rule against bon appétit.</p>
        <p>''I've never heard anyone telling me bon appétit was not polite,'' said Mia Hansen, 25, a film director, as she ate at an old restaurant in the Bastille section. ''Everybody says it all the time.''</p>
