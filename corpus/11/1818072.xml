        <p>Starbucks has made its second book selection, and it's no Mitch Albom. ''A Long Way Gone'' by Ishmael Beah, a memoir of that first-time author's life as a child soldier in war-ravaged Sierra Leone, will be sold in about 6,000 Starbucks stores beginning on Feb. 15, the company plans to announce today. Mr. Albom's ''For One More Day,'' the sentimental novel that inaugurated the company's book-sale program, has sold roughly 92,000 copies in Starbucks stores since going on sale on Sept. 26. Comparing the two titles, Ken Lombard, the president of Starbucks Entertainment, said ''A Long Way Gone'' was ''opposite in terms of the type of book, but consistent with our overall strategy of quality books.'' The company, he added, is ''convinced our customers are going to love this.'' Beginning next month, Mr. Beah will give readings at Starbucks in 10 cities. ''A Long Way Gone'' is published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.</p>
