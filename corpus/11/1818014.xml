        <p>The three principals of the KL Group in West Palm Beach, Fla., a firm that operated many hedge funds that collapsed in early 2005, were indicted yesterday, accused of orchestrating an extensive fraud that raised more than $194 million from at least 250 investors.</p>
        <p>The three, Won Sok Lee, Yung Bae Kim and his brother Jung Bae Kim, who was also known as John B. Kim, are accused of promoting the KL hedge funds as successful, when, in fact, some of the funds suffered losses every quarter of their existence.</p>
        <p>For instance, from 2000 to 2005, KL told investors that its main hedge fund earned more than 100 percent each year. In fact, from 2003 to 2004, the main fund lost approximately $63 million in unprofitable trades, according to the indictment, which was handed up by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida.</p>
        <p>The collapse of the KL Group was the subject of an article in The New York Times in August 2005 that detailed how the three principals used their expensively furnished West Palm Beach office and high-tech trading floor to lure some of Palm Beach's elite to invest in the funds. Prosecutors say that some money was also siphoned off for the personal use of the three principals.</p>
        <p>The scheme was further carried out, court filings say, by paying a handful of early investors with money from new investors and using counterfeit documents to report investment returns falsely to mislead lawyers and accountants as well as investors.</p>
        <p>John Kim, who faces 35 counts of various criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, pleaded not guilty yesterday in Federal District Court in West Palm Beach. Calls to lawyers for Mr. Kim were not returned.</p>
        <p>The other two individuals remain fugitives and are believed to be living outside of the country, according to an individual briefed on the case.</p>
