        <p>Editorial criticizes program in Arkansas and other states that measures students' body mass index and sends home 'obesity report cards'; says schools should serve healthier foods and focus on physical education instead of demoralizing students with fat label</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Over the last three decades, the number of overweight children in America has tripled to 16 percent, so it would seem that anything that can help kids get to a healthy weight is worth considering. But schools aren't helping if children think they're being labeled as fat. That could be the effect of a program pioneered in Arkansas, which three years ago began measuring students' body mass index -- or B.M.I., a calculation based on weight and height -- and then sending home what kids are calling ''obesity report cards.'' Pennsylvania and West Virginia do similar surveys, and about a dozen states, including New York, have bills to follow suit.</p>
        <p>As Jodi Kantor reported in The Times this week, B.M.I. scores and the percentile rankings can confuse already overburdened parents and demoralize students, who now have one more grade to consider. The index also isn't a particularly precise measurement tool. Muscles, which weigh more than fat, can push up a B.M.I., labeling even a young athlete as physically unfit. If schools are going to hand out B.M.I. reports they need to do a better job explaining their significance to parents and children.</p>

        <p>Schools certainly need to do more to help students manage their weight by limiting the sale of junk food and by serving less nachos and more fresh vegetables in cafeterias. Educators should also pump up gym classes. In an environment in which even a pimple can upset the fragile social pecking order, why add the stress of having to make weight?</p>
