        <p>Podcasters and others in need of audio recordings no longer need to stick a microphone in their subjects' faces. The Olympus DS-50 voice recorder has a clip-on stereo microphone that will pick up both sides of a conversation.</p>
        <p>The DS-50 is specifically designed for creating and listening to podcasts. It can record at CD quality (also known as a 44.1 kilohertz sampling rate) and connects to any PC with a U.S.B. cable. It can also play back MP3 and WMA files, allowing it to double as an audiobook reader and music player.</p>

        <p>Podcasters and others in need of audio recordings no longer need to stick a microphone in their subjects' faces. The Olympus DS-50 voice recorder has a clip-on stereo microphone that will pick up both sides of a conversation.</p>
        <p>The DS-50 is specifically designed for creating and listening to podcasts. It can record at CD quality (also known as a 44.1 kilohertz sampling rate) and connects to any PC with a U.S.B. cable. It can also play back MP3 and WMA files, allowing it to double as an audiobook reader and music player.</p>
        <p>The recorder's microphone can clip to a tie or lapel, allowing the recorder to remain unobtrusive. Its one gigabyte of memory can hold around 275 hours of audio at average quality. Voice prompts describe current settings and audibly confirm commands.</p>
        <p>The $249 DS-50 also has less expensive kin: the $150 DS-30 with 256 megabytes of memory, and the $200 DS-40 with 512 megabytes. All three will be available online and at retail stores this month.</p>
        <p>While almost anything can record audio these days, only the DS-50 can do it while nestled discreetly in a pocket.</p>
