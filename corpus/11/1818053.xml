        <p>President Bush's new plan differs in several respects from the faltering effort to bring stability to Baghdad that began last summer. It calls for a much larger American force. There are to be no safe havens for renegade militias.

        <p>President Bush's new plan differs in several respects from the faltering effort to bring stability to Baghdad that began last summer. It calls for a much larger American force. There are to be no safe havens for renegade militias. And Iraqi security forces throughout the city are to be put under the direct control of a new Iraqi commander -- and backed up by American Army battalions.</p>
        <p>But the plan depends on the good intentions and competence of a Shiite-dominated Iraqi government that has not demonstrated an abundant supply of either. Mr. Bush, in effect, is betting that Iraqi leaders are committed to building a multisectarian state, and his strategy will stand or fall on that assumption.</p>
