        <p>In last November's election, which made Eliot Spitzer governor, the press and politicians made much of the size of his record victory. In the initial vote totals, based largely on unofficial election data and exit polls, Mr. Spitzer had about 70 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>But the State Board of Elections released the certified figures this week that showed that Mr. Spitzer won with 65.7 percent.</p>
        <p>The board's certified figures show that Mr. Spitzer and his running mate, Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson, received 3,086,709 votes and that a total of 4,701,065 votes were cast. Mr. Spitzer ran on the Democratic, Independence and Working Families Parties' lines.</p>
        <p>Despite the lowered totals, Mr. Spitzer still scored a record percentage for a governor's race, beating Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's 64.6 percent in 1986.</p>
        <p>While the official figure is not as high as previously thought, some Democratic officials and political consultants say that the difference is insignificant in political terms. The early, unofficial count showed that Mr. Spitzer received 69.6 percent of the vote among those who did vote for governor.</p>
        <p>''It may be of academic interest to some. A percentage point here or there doesn't change the fact that Eliot Spitzer won a huge victory,'' said Evan Stavisky, a political consultant who works with Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>''The official results often are different from the initial numbers,'' he said. ''But no matter how you slice it, it was a stunning victory for Eliot Spitzer. For most New Yorkers, the major issue is who won and who lost. The different in the percentage is a matter that will quickly be lost in the dustbin of history.''</p>
