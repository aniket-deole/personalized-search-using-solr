        <p>Parliament voted to allow the relocation of war memorials and soldiers' graves, a move critics have said was intended to eliminate Soviet-era monuments. The country's ethnic Russians, joined by lawmakers and officials in Russia, have denounced the proposal, saying it was meant to remove the Bronze Soldier, a monument in the capital, Tallinn, to the Red Army soldiers who died in World War II, as well as other Soviet objects. For many in Estonia, absorbed into the Soviet Union during the war, the monuments symbolize occupation and totalitarianism.</p>
