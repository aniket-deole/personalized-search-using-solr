His was a strong, articulate, consistent voice of advocacy for social and economic justice, and for the principles of democratic socialism. His wise, clear-headed counsel, delivered with a calm dignity at all times, will be sorely missed. We offer our deepest sympathies to his wife Miriam and to his family.
