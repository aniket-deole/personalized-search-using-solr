        <p>A man whose brother was shot and killed late Tuesday by an off-duty state corrections officer during a traffic dispute was charged yesterday with second-degree assault, the police said. The man, Leroi Kenner, 45, and his brother, Chris Kenner, 36, both of Queens, attacked the officer, Emilio Maldonado, 29, after he honked at them near La Guardia Airport when they failed to accelerate after their traffic light turned green, the police said. According to a witness, the police said, the men punched the officer in the face through an open car window. Then, realizing that he was an officer, they shouted, ''Shoot the cop, shoot the cop.'' According to the witness, the police said, one of the brothers reached for his waistband as if to retrieve a gun, and the officer shot once, striking Chris Kenner in the torso. He was taken to a Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he died. The investigation is continuing, but Officer Maldonado has not been charged. A spokeswoman for the Department of Correctional Services, Linda Foglia, said Officer Maldonado's use of his weapon appeared to be proper procedure.</p>
