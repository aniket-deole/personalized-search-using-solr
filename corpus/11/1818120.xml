      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The University of Michigan acceded to a federal appeals court decision and said it would immediately comply with the state's new ban on affirmative action in public education, employment or contracting. The Michigan ballot initiative banning preferences based on race or gender passed overwhelmingly in November and was to go into effect on Dec. 23. But the University of Michigan, together with Michigan State University and Wayne State University, went to court seeking a six-month delay, on the ground that they were midway through an admissions cycle. A federal district judge granted the delay on Dec. 19, but on Dec. 29, a federal appeals court ordered immediate compliance.</p>
