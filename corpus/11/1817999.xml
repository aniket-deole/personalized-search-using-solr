        <p>Epson introduces Stylus Photo 1400 printer that it says will produce photographic prints that last 98 years and print three times as fast as its 1280 ink-jet printer; photo (S)</p>

        <p>Digital photographers and graphic designers with limited budgets will want to note Epson's replacement for its venerable 1280 ink-jet printer, introduced in 2000. The Stylus Photo 1400, which will reach the market early next month, will cost the same as the older model -- $400 -- and will still use six inks, but they will be Epson's new Claria inks.</p>
        <p>Epson says these will produce prints that last 98 years, three times the life span of earlier inks. It also says the 1400 will print three times as fast, with the ink yielding three times as many prints.</p>

        <p>Digital photographers and graphic designers with limited budgets will want to note Epson's replacement for its venerable 1280 ink-jet printer, introduced in 2000. The Stylus Photo 1400, which will reach the market early next month, will cost the same as the older model -- $400 -- and will still use six inks, but they will be Epson's new Claria inks.</p>
        <p>Epson says these will produce prints that last 98 years, three times the life span of earlier inks. It also says the 1400 will print three times as fast, with the ink yielding three times as many prints.</p>
        <p>An 8-by-10-inch photo at 720 dots per inch will take 173 seconds to print on the 1400, which may sound long but is fairly sprightly in the photo printer world.</p>
        <p>Labeling of white ink-jet-printable CDs and DVDs is a feature found in many lower-end Epson printers, but the 1400 has a higher-precision mechanism -- hence its 25.8-pound heft. Automatic photo correction will handle red eye, underexposure and color problems. The maximum print is 13 by 19 inches.</p>
