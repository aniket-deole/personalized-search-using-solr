        <p>RUNNERS intending to enter spring marathons need to start training this month, regardless of the weather. Treadmills suffice, but for adventurous runners nothing beats getting outside even if it's the morning after a snowfall.</p>
        <p>Cleated running shoes that work like studded snow tires and shoe strap-ons that work like tire chains give runners traction on snowy and icy roads. And there are more traction products than ever to lure skittish runners outdoors.</p>
        <p>''It's important to run on the surface you are going to race on, and these shoes allow runners to take what Mother Nature throws at them,'' said John Schweizer, president of Garmont.</p>
