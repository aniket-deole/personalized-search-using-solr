        <p>THE Parsons table is to décor what the little black dress is to fashion: A decorating staple that can be dressed up or down, depending on its finish. In gold leaf or python, it is at home in the most formal setting; with a coat of paint, it is comfortable in a casual room.</p>

        <p>THE Parsons table is to décor what the little black dress is to fashion: A decorating staple that can be dressed up or down, depending on its finish. In gold leaf or python, it is at home in the most formal setting; with a coat of paint, it is comfortable in a casual room.</p>
        <p>''It is a universal design that is highly adaptable,'' said Christopher Mount, the director of exhibitions and public programs at Parsons the New School for Design in New York. ''It never looks dated.''</p>
        <p>The original Parsons table was designed in the 1930s by Jean-Michel Frank and a group of design students at Parsons Paris, where he was a visiting critic. Since then, the table, with its squared legs, has been made in many sizes and materials. Depending on its size, it can be used as a console, a desk, a dining table, a coffee table or a small end table.</p>
        <p>1. An 18-by-60-by-29 1/2-inch-high console table covered in python skin is $10,000 at Edelman Leather; to the trade only, at edelmanleather.com or (800) 886-8339.</p>
        <p>2. The Margot table has an ash frame and a Corian top. It is 90 by 36 by 29 inches high and sells for $4,590 at Dune; dune-ny.com or 88 Franklin Street, (212) 925-6171.</p>
        <p>3. A low Parsons table, which can be used as a side table or a coffee table, was designed by Paul Evans and made in the 1970s. The table, 30 inches square by 24 1/2 inches high, is made of olive wood and sells for $4,000 at Todd Merrill Antiques; merrillantiques.com or (212) 673-0531.</p>
        <p>4. The Lack Side Table, which is 21 5/8 inches square and 17 3/4 inches high, comes in eight colors. It is $12.99 at Ikea; ikea.com or (800) 434-4532.</p>
        <p>5. The glass top of this 26-by-22-by-21-inch-high table is supported by an acrylic base; $695 from plexi-craft.com, (212) 924-3244 or (800) 247-5394 outside the metropolitan New York area.</p>
        <p>6. The Parsons Desk with drawers, 48 by 24 by 30 inches high, comes in pale blue, light green, white or dark brown; $279 at westelm.com or (888) 922-4119.</p>
        <p>7. The Primavera Parsons Table by Daniel Donnelly is 74 by 39 inches and 28 inches high. It is shown in blond mahogany, for $2,600 (in maple, it sells for $2,200); danieldonnelly.com or (703) 549-4672.</p>
        <p>8. A 39-by-66-inch burled wood dining table designed by Milo Baughman for Thayer Coggin was made in the 1970s. It has two additional leaves and sells for $2,650 at White Trash; whitetrashnyc.com or (212) 598-5956.</p>
