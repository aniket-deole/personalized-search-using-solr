        <p>As President Bush challenges public opinion at home by committing more American troops, he is confronted by a paradox: an Iraqi government that does not really want them. The Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has not publicly opposed the troop increase, but aides to Mr. Maliki have been saying for weeks that the government is wary of the proposal.</p>

They want American troops to focus on fighting Sunni insurgents.</p>
