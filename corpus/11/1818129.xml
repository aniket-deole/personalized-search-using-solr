        <p>A former aide to Jimmy Meng, the first Asian-American member of the State Assembly, has been charged with voter registration fraud, the Queens district attorney's office said yesterday. Simon Ting, 42, of Flushing, who resigned after Mr. Meng chose not to run for re-election last year, submitted voter registration paperwork in 2004 for 36 people who did not live in Mr. Meng's district. None of the people voted or attempted to vote in the 2004 election, prosecutors said. Mr. Ting was charged with offering a false instrument for filing and procuring false documents, and faces up to four years in prison if convicted.</p>
