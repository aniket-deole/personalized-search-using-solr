        <p>A consortium of investors is considering making an offer worth more than $38 billion for Equity Office Properties Trust, the real estate investment trust that is controlled by Samuel Zell, people involved in the discussions said last night.</p>
        <p>The investors, which include Cerberus Capital Management, Starwood Capital and Walton Street Capital, have talked among themselves about preparing a bid, these people said. If the group bids for Equity Office, the nation's largest owner and manager of office buildings, it would seek to top a deal reached in November to sell the company to the Blackstone Group for $36 billion.</p>
        <p>While people involved said last night that executives were interested in making a offer, it remained possible that the group could decide against such an bid.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for Cerberus and Barry Sternlicht of Starwood Capital declined to comment. A spokesman for Neil Bluhm of Walton Street Capital could not be reached.</p>
        <p>An offer by the consortium could result in a bidding war for Equity Office, pitting two of the most powerful financial firms in the nation against each other for a deal that would be the largest leveraged buyout in history, surpassing the $33 billion that a consortium of private equity groups paid for the health care company HCA Inc. in August.</p>
        <p>A bid by the consortium would also be one of the first instances of a private equity firm's trying to top another firm's deal after an agreement had been struck.</p>
        <p>When Blackstone reached its deal with Equity Office, the purchase price -- $48.50 a share -- was instantly derided by some shareholders as too low. James S. Corl, the chief investment officer for the real estate firm Cohen &amp; Steers, the largest shareholder in Equity Office, criticized the deal publicly and suggested that another bidder should emerge.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of Equity Office's agreement with Blackstone, Equity Office can consider offers from rival bidders. A shareholder vote on that deal is scheduled for Feb. 5. If the consortium were to top Blackstone's offer, Blackstone would be entitled to a breakup fee of $200 million. Blackstone also has the right to match any rival offer.</p>
        <p>Speculation about a rival offer has been increasing in recent weeks. Yesterday, Jonathan Litt, an analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note to investors that he expected a ''topping bid'' of $50 to $52 a share.</p>
        <p>Shares of Equity Office closed at $48.75, above Blackstone's offer, in anticipation of another bid.</p>
