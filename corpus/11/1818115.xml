        <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has a new, resonant date with destiny.

        <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has a new, resonant date with destiny. NASA has set Sept. 11, 2008, as the target date for launching a mission intended to revitalize the telescope and keep it spaceworthy into the next decade, according to a planning document made public by nasawatch.com, an independent Web site.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Sean O'Keefe, then the NASA administrator, decided to forgo Hubble telescope maintenance in the wake of the shuttle Columbia disaster, prompting a nationwide debate about the risks of shuttle flights and the value of the telescope. Michael D. Griffin, the current NASA administrator, reversed Mr. O'Keefe's decision.</p>
        <p>In a series of spacewalks, astronauts from the shuttle Atlantis will replace vital gyroscopes and batteries and install a new camera and a new spectrograph, extending the telescope's capabilities into new realms of the electromagnetic spectrum, Dr. Griffin announced in October.</p>
        <p>The selection of a noteworthy date, the seventh anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States, was not deliberate or official, said a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The spokesman said that it was only a target date on an internal document and that it could change after a review. Shuttle schedules and launching dates are notoriously tentative, and delays often occur because of the complexity of the launching preparations.</p>
        <p>This year, NASA plans five shuttle missions. But William W. Parsons, director of the Kennedy Space Center, said yesterday at a briefing that one of them could slip into next year.</p>
