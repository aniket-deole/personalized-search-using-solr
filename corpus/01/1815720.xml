Beloved husband of the late Marguerite (Peggy) Murtagh, beloved father of Perry III, Betsey, Susan, Connie, and Ann. A founding member of the computer industry, his ''fearless and imaginative jumps into the future'' established the foundations for digital computing in 1942, contributed to Project Whirlwind, designed the SABRE System for American Airlines , foresaw danger as the industry deviated from ''accounting and engineering principles,'' and envisioned ''a whole new way of understanding'' for us all.
