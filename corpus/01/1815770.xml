        <p>Eliot Laurence Spitzer begins his term as the state's 54th governor today. He has pledged to reform the way the state does business and to bring a higher ethical standard to Albany. He recently outlined a number of sweeping steps that he would take unilaterally, including restricting campaign contributions and banning gifts of more than nominal value. But after promising to look far and wide for talent, many of his appointees come from the attorney general's office, or from his campaign staff. Some key positions remain unfilled, including the job of health commissioner. Here are the top officials who have been named, many of whom require Senate confirmation.</p>
        <p>DANNY HAKIM</p>
