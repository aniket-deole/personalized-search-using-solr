        <p>In Mexico, the traditional way of making hot chocolate involves using folkloric equipment to produce a steaming drink capped by delicious froth. This bit of culinary performance art will be done at tableside starting tomorrow at Zócalo, 174 East 82nd Street; (212) 717-7772.</p>
        <p>Solid chocolate is broken up into a tall earthenware or ceramic pot of boiling water and beaten with an intricately carved wooden implement called a molinillo, which is twirled between the hands. It is possibly the world's earliest hand-held blender. The result is often thicker yet lighter-tasting than standard hot chocolate, and when it's made with genuine Mexican chocolate tablets, it will have a soupçon of cinnamon.</p>

        <p>The hot chocolate is $6 or $10 for one spiked with tequila at the restaurant. Mexican chocolate tablets ($4.20 to $10) and molinillos ($5.95) are sold at Kitchen Market, 218 Eighth Avenue (21st Street); (888) 468-4433 or kitchenmarket.com.</p>
