        <p>Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema issued an urgent plea to his political allies for an end to the bickering among parties that he worries could bring down the center-left government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi. ''I am going to Japan,'' he said in an interview in the newspaper La Repubblica. ''I humbly ask our allies: Let there still be a government on my return.'' Since taking power from Silvio Berluconi last spring, Mr. Prodi has faced deep divisions in his diverse, nine-party coalition. In recent days, a proposed law allowing for same-sex unions has added tension.</p>
