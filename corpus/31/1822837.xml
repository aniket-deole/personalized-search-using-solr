        <p>Correction of Dec 18 obituary of Herbert Gursky</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An obituary on Dec. 18 about Herbert Gursky, an astrophysicist who studied the sources of X-rays from outside the solar system, referred imprecisely to some of these sources. A distant star he discovered is in the constellation Scorpius, not Scorpio, and the star was designated Scorpius X-1, not just Scorpius. The first recorded example of a black hole, which he and others discovered in 1971, was designated Cygnus X-1 or Cygnus XR-1 -- not just Cygnus. The errors were pointed out on Dec. 19 in an e-mail message that was misdirected within The Times. The correction was further delayed for research.</p>
