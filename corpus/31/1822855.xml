        <p>Boris I. Tarasyuk, the foreign minister, resigned after a constitutional dispute over his post. Mr. Tarasyuk has been a close ally of President Viktor A. Yushchenko and the most vocal proponent of leading Ukraine closer to the European Union and NATO. Parliament voted to dismiss him in December and later moved to remove the president's power to appoint ministers overseeing foreign and defense matters, a move a weakened Mr. Yushchenko declared unconstitutional. Mr. Tarasyuk, in televised remarks reported by news agencies, said he resigned after a court hearing in the dispute was postponed. Mr. Yushchenko's office declared that he would appoint a successor.</p>
