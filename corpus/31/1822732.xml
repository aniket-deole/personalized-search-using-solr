        <p>CHEFS ON THE MOVE</p>
        <p>BILL YOSSES, who worked at Bouley and the Citarella stores, is the new pastry chef for the White House, replacing Thaddeus R. DuBois.</p>
        <p>CHRISTOPHE BELLANCA, below, who went to L'Orangerie in Hollywood in 2004 from Pic, a Michelin two-star restaurant in Valence, France, has now settled into his new job as executive chef at Le Cirque. He replaces Pierre Schaedelin, who still works for the Le Cirque organization. L'Orangerie has closed, and is to become a Nobu.</p>
        <p>AKHTAR NAWAB, the chef who lost his position at the still-unopened Allen &amp; Delancey about a month ago, is now the chef at E.U. (European Union) in the East Village. E.U. has had a very bumpy ride from the start, with its struggle to obtain a wine license, then a parade of chefs coming and going. Sara Ochs, who left Esca to be E.U.'s chef last fall and who left after a couple of months, is now working at the Spotted Pig.</p>
        <p>JULIAN MEDINA, the executive chef at Zócalo on the Upper East Side, has left. His replacement is Joseph Cacace, formerly the executive chef at Il Bastardo.</p>
        <p>NICOLE KAPLAN, who was the executive pastry chef at Eleven Madison Park, has taken that job at Del Posto. A new executive pastry chef has not been named.</p>
        <p>COLLEEN GRAPES, who previously worked at Al Forno in Providence, R.I., and the Red Cat in New York, is the new pastry chef at 7Square in the Time Hotel in the theater district.</p>
        <p>OPEN NOW</p>
        <p>OSTIA -- A Spanish wine bar with a pressed tin wall, tapas, larger plates and hams carved tableside, serves sangria and Spanish wines only: 113 Seventh Avenue South (Christopher Street), (212) 924-2305.</p>
        <p>MOVING</p>
        <p>SMITH &amp; VINE -- Tomorrow, this Carroll Gardens wine shop will relocate to larger quarters, with a tasting room, a block from its original location: 268 Smith Street (DeGraw Street), Brooklyn, (718) 243-2864.</p>
        <p>CLOSED</p>
        <p>IXTA, an ambitious Mexican spot on East 29th Street.</p>
