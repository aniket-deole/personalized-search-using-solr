        <p>A West Virginia judge ordered an injunction yesterday that allowed the high school basketball star O. J. Mayo to play last night in a game featuring two of the country's top teams.</p>
        <p>Mayo, considered the best guard prospect since LeBron James, had 19 points and 12 rebounds for Huntington High School in a 73-66 victory against Artesia High of Lakewood, Calif., at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, N.C. The game was part of the Hoophall Classic, a tripleheader matching elite high school teams. Huntington is ranked No. 2 nationally and Artesia No. 11.</p>
        <p>Mayo was initially suspended from the game because he received two technical fouls in a game Friday night. The resulting two-game suspension, automatic under state rules, caused a furor around West Virginia because of the questionable nature of the second technical foul.</p>
        <p>The referee Mike Lazo appeared to exaggerate his fall to the ground when Mayo approached him, adding a bizarre twist to the incident. Video from the game played on the Web has fueled the story nationally.</p>
        <p>According to a copy of the court documents, the order from Chief Judge Dan P. O'Hanlon of Cabell County allowed Mayo to play because, among other reasons, he ''will suffer immediate and irreparable injury before the adverse party can fully be heard in opposition.''</p>
        <p>The injunction also said that the West Virginia Secondary School Athletic Commission's decision to apply its rules to out-of-state contests was ''clearly wrong.'' In a separate ruling, the five Huntington reserves who were thrown out of Friday's game for leaving the bench after Mayo was ejected were also allowed to play last night.</p>
