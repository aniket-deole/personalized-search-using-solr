        <p>NOTIAS--Harry N. Beloved husband of Phyllis Thravalos, cherished father of daughter, Irene and son, Nicholas on January 28, 2007 at New York Presbyterian Hospital from complications after a stroke. He is also survived by a loving sister, many nieces and nephews, devoted friends and loyal employees. ''Captain Harry'' as he was fondly known, immigrated from Greece at age 18, became a US citizen and served with pride in the army during World War II. He was a selfmade man who achieved the American dream. He came from a close-knit family of modest means, became a Captain in the U.S. Maritime Service and later founded a successful shipping business, Independence Maritime, with offices in New York and Greece. He was known for his courage, hard work, loyalty, independence and generosity. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Attn.: Dr. Carolyn Britton, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032.
