      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Four employees of the Old Homestead steakhouse in Chelsea filed a lawsuit yesterday in Federal District Court charging the restaurant with improperly operating a tipping pool, and with denying them minimum and overtime wages. The plaintiffs charge that the restaurant, at 56 Ninth Avenue, deprived its waiters of more than $1 million in income over the past six years. The suit, filed by Louis Pechman of the law firm of Berke-Weiss &amp; Pechman LLP, claims Old Homestead operated a tipping pool for employees and managers who were not eligible to receive tips. According to federal and state labor laws, only those employees connected with the actual serving of food and beverages are eligible for participation in a tip pool. Marc Sherry, who owns the restaurant, said he was unaware of the suit and declined to comment.</p>
