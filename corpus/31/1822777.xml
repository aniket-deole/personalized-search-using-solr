        <p>THE WII IS THE RAGE -- Nintendo's Wii, the innovative game console, has upset the order of the video game world by taking the lead in buzz and sales over another new console, the Sony PlayStation 3. [C1.]</p>
        <p>STUMBLING START -- The dip in Sony's quarterly earnings underscores the shaky start of its long-awaited PlayStation 3 console. [C3.]</p>

        <p>DOUBTS EDGE ECONOMY's OPTIMISM -- Consumers were feeling confident in January: the job market was chugging along and oil prices were down. But their optimism may dwindle on concerns that job and wage growth may slow. [C10.]</p>
        <p>SHARES END THE DAY HIGHER -- Stocks finished moderately higher in an uneven session as optimism about the economy helped investors overcome some of their apprehension about the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.[C11.]</p>
