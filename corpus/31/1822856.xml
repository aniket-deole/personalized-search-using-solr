        <p>The Labor Party's chief fund-raiser, Lord Levy, was arrested as part of an investigation into whether the party elevated people to the House of Lords in exchange for loans. It was the second time that Lord Levy, left, a close ally of Prime Minister Tony Blair, has been arrested in the inquiry; he has not been charged with a crime. The police have arrested three others, none of whom have been charged, in their investigation, and have spoken to more than 90 people, including Mr. Blair and Michael Howard, the former leader of the Conservative Party. A spokesman for Lord Levy said he ''completely denies any allegations of wrongdoing whatsoever.''</p>
