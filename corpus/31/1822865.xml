        <p>A day laborer doing tile work at a Brooklyn construction site died yesterday after he lost his bearings and fell four stories through an open elevator shaft, officials said. The man, whose identity was not immediately known, was pronounced dead at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center at 11:18 a.m., an hour after the accident, the police said. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the city's Buildings Department are investigating. A Buildings Department spokeswoman, Kate Lindquist, said that a stop work order was issued because no guardrails were in place, as required, around elevator openings. A superintendent at Nesher Construction, the general contractor, said that the victim worked for a subcontractor and that protective plywood had been in place over ''all the elevator openings'' at the start of work.</p>
