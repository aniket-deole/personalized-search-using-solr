      <abstract>
        <p>Three letters comment on Jan 24 article about vegan chef and cookbook author Isa Chandra Moskowitz; Devery Doleman contends there is no deprivation in vegan diet and that, in fact, it provides wide variety of foods and is healthier way to eat; Janice Iannelli is frustrated by criticism of vegan food; Karin J Lauria praises veganism as compassionate way to eat</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed ''Strict Vegan Ethics, Frosted With Hedonism'' (Jan. 24) but take issue with the characterization of an animal-free diet as ascetic. The article stated that Isa Chandra Moskowitz ''makes even the deprivations of veganism and the rage of punk seem like fun.''</p>
        <p>Deprivations? Since adopting a vegan diet one year ago, I lost 20 pounds while eating whatever I wanted, have clearer skin at age 34 than at age 10, and went up a bra size while shaving 30 points from my cholesterol count. My husband and I enjoy Thai, Korean, Japanese, Caribbean, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and Ethiopian cuisine, and cook at home more often and more creatively than before.</p>

        <p>I am, however, depriving myself of the growth hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, arsenic, prions and fecal matter present in factory-farmed meat.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is frustrating when people say that a lot of vegan food is awful. It's not because it's vegan that it tastes awful, but because it's a bad recipe or because the person can't cook. I have no shortage of memories from my omnivorous days of terrible meals made with animal products.</p>
        <p>Fine vegan food is filled with not only rich, vibrant flavor, but also with a peacefulness that comes from its cruelty-free, compassionate foundation.</p>
        <p>Janice Iannelli  Lincoln Park, N.J.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your writer states that omnivores are ''meat-and-dairy eaters,'' but this obscures the fact that vegans, too, are omnivores by nature. The article underemphasized what we should most admire about vegans, namely, that their eating habits reflect a moral choice to minimize harm to the world around them, particularly to animals. Furthermore, Ms. Moskowitz states that omnivores ''can't imagine baking without eggs and butter.'' I, however, am a conscientious omnivore who simply can't imagine baking.</p>
