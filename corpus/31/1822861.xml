        <p>A woman was fatally shot in the head as she sat in the driver's seat of her car last evening at a park-and-ride lot near Pleasant Plains Avenue, the police said. The woman, Jean Kane, 58, was declared dead on arrival at Staten Island South Hospital, the police said. An officer who was nearby heard the shot shortly before 6 p.m. and arrived at the scene to find Ms. Kane's body slumped in her four-door gray Volkswagen. Investigators say that someone probably drove up to Ms. Kane's car, got out, shot her through a window and drove away.</p>
