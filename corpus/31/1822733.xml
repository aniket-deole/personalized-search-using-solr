        <p>A preciously intricate sushi omakase, or chef's choice -- the term literally means ''trusting the chef'' -- is now available to go from Sushi of Gari (402 East 78th Street, 212-517-5340) and the new Sushi of Gari 46 (347 West 46th Street, 212- 957-0046). This collection of items is an indulgence, not your usual sushi takeout.</p>
        <p>Toro, uni, lobster, salmon, shiso leaves and fried lotus are a few of the ingredients that the chefs will artfully fashion into sushi and rolls. There are about 14 pieces in all, arranged in a black and silver box; prices start at $65, depending on the ingredients.</p>

        <p>Orders must be placed at least one hour in advance, and will be delivered at no charge within a 10-block radius of the restaurant. They can also be picked up. Because the sushi is made fresh, to order, the rice will still be warm, so it's best to time your order so that it can be eaten without delay.</p>
