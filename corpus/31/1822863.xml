        <p>Richard West, a member of the New York chapter of the Hells Angels, says he will file a lawsuit against the city, claiming that he was illegally taken into custody after a search of the motorcycle club's East Village headquarters at 77 East Third Street on Monday. Dozens of police officers, backed by sharpshooters, helicopters and heavy equipment, used a search warrant to seek evidence connected to the beating of a woman outside the building on Sunday night. Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer for the Hells Angels, said the police used excessive force. The club had refused to allow several officers to enter the heavily fortified building, so the larger contingent arrived.</p>
