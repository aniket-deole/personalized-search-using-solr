        <p>With its combination of ''Prison Break'' and ''24,'' Fox edged ahead of NBC on Monday to win the important demographic of adults 18 to 49. According to Nielsen's estimates, ''Prison Break'' matched a season's best 9.9 million viewers at 8 p.m., while the sixth hour of ''24'' earned 14 million viewers to lead the 9 p.m. hour in total viewers ahead of NBC's ''Heroes'' (13.6 million). ''Heroes'' did remain the night's highest-rated show in the 18 to 49 demographic, ahead of second-place ''24.'' For the night, NBC outdrew Fox by a half million total viewers. Its game show at 8, ''Deal or No Deal,'' claimed the title of most-watched show on Monday (16.9 million), but the 10 o'clock hour remained NBC's weakest, as ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' attracted 7 million viewers opposite a repeat of CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (13.4 million). CBS broadcast reruns of its comedy lineup from 8 to 10 and finished third over all. ABC was fourth, despite new episodes of ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.7 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (5.7 million).</p>
