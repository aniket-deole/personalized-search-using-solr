        <p>A New Jersey lawyer pleaded not guilty to prostitution and money-laundering charges yesterday as his lawyer accused the Manhattan district attorney of letting his ''personal feelings'' influence the prosecution.</p>
        <p>An assistant district attorney, Linda Ford, said during the arraignment of the lawyer, Paul W. Bergrin, that he had not only helped run a brothel at 79 Worth Street in Lower Manhattan but had patronized the establishment and had brought friends to the brothel for free sex.</p>
        <p>But a lawyer for Mr. Bergrin, Jeffrey Lichtman, accused the district attorney's office of inflating the seriousness of the charges by asking that his client be held in jail without bail.</p>
        <p>''Counsel can only surmise that the tremendous publicity surrounding this case and the district attorney's personal feelings toward the defendant have influenced the draconian request for detention,'' Mr. Lichtman wrote in a brief.</p>
        <p>Justice Michael R. Ambrecht of State Supreme Court in Manhattan later set Mr. Bergrin's bail at $1 million bond or $500,000 cash, with 72 hours for prosecutors to review the source of the money.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau declined to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergrin, 51, of Morganville, N.J., is a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. He is accused of using two shell companies in 2004 and 2005 to launder $800,000 in credit card receipts from a call girl service based in TriBeCa named NY Confidential, prosecutors have said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lichtman said that Jason Itzler, the brothel's founder and Mr. Bergrin's client, had been accused of laundering millions in prostitution money -- as opposed to the $800,000 Mr. Bergrin is accused of laundering.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Itzler was released on $250,000 bail after his indictment in 2005, and was sentenced last week to one and a half to three years in prison, Mr. Lichtman said.</p>
