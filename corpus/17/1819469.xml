        <p>After an intense 10-day manhunt, the Paterson police arrested an Irvington man on Tuesday morning and charged him with fatally shooting an off-duty rookie police officer here.</p>
        <p>The Paterson police received more than 150 tips -- many based on a suspect sketch released last week -- about the Jan. 7 killing of Officer Tyron D. Franklin, 23. After a tip over the past weekend, the police arrested Teddy Charlemagne, 23, as he left a friend's apartment in Irvington about 8 a.m., a Paterson police spokesman, Lt. Anthony Traina, said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Charlemagne, who was on parole after having been convicted of four narcotics and weapons felonies, was held on Tuesday on first-degree murder and weapons charges, said the Passaic County prosecutor, James F. Avigliano. He said his office would seek the death penalty for Mr. Charlemagne.</p>
        <p>Officer Franklin, 23, was in the Broadway Fried Chicken restaurant on Broadway near Madison Avenue, in Paterson, ordering food about 1 a.m. on Jan. 7 when a man entered and demanded money, the authorities said. After a brief scuffle, the man shot Officer Franklin, who was not armed, and fled in a light-colored minivan, according to the police and witnesses.</p>
        <p>''The motive was robbery,'' Lieutenant Traina said. ''It was a botched robbery that led to his demise.''</p>
        <p>Twice the police said they believed that they had captured Officer Franklin's killer, once after a car chase in East Orange, and again on Friday after surrounding an apartment building in Jersey City. Both times proved to be cases of mistaken identity, Lieutenant Traina said.</p>
        <p>The person who called in the tip to the police that led to the arrest could receive a $60,000 reward if Mr. Charlemagne is convicted. Mr. Charlemagne is being held at the Passaic County jail in $2 million bail and is to be arraigned on Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>The Paterson police chief, James Wittig, said that many officers had volunteered their time in the search for Officer Franklin's killer and that there was a sense of some closure when the suspect ''was apprehended and will be brought to justice.''</p>
        <p>Officer Franklin, the father of a 16-month-old boy, Tyron Jr., was buried on Saturday and was remembered as a dedicated officer who came from a family steeped in public service. His father, Larry Franklin, is a retired captain with the Paterson Fire Department.</p>
        <p>Standing near a shrine in front of the police administration building on Tuesday, the Rev. Michael Burton, a spokesman for the family, said relatives were still coming to grips with Officer Franklin's death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton said relatives were somewhat relieved by the arrest. ''What this does is to help to deal with the situation, but it doesn't take the pain away,'' he said.</p>
