        <p>The government said a terrorism suspect had absconded after being served with what is known as a control order, a form of house arrest that would require him to report daily to the police, surrender his travel documents and reside at an address known to the authorities. The man was not identified by name, but John Reid, the home secretary, said he ''had recently been radicalized and wanted to travel abroad for terrorism-related purposes.''
