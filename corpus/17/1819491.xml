        <p>Fox is No 1 in ratings for Sunday and Monday night, despite broadcast of two part, four hour season premiere of series 24; CBS is No 1 in ratings for Sunday night with playoff football and 60 Minutes; NBC is No 1 in ratings for Monday night with broadcast of Golden Globe awards (S)</p>

        <p>The latest day-in-the-life of the counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) on ''24'' got off to a solid start in the ratings on Sunday and Monday, but opposite heavy competition Fox finished both nights in second place. According to Nielsen's estimates, the Day 6 debut earned 15.7 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m. Sunday, a slight decline over its year-ago season premiere (16.2 million). However, Monday's two-hour second installment also drew 15.7 million viewers, a modest improvement over the fifth season's second episode (14.9 million). CBS was No. 1 on Sunday, benefiting from an overrun of its N.F.L. playoffs coverage, followed by an interview with President Bush on ''60 Minutes'' at approximately 8:30 (17.2 million). ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' (16.7 million) also outdrew ''24'' during the 9 p.m. hour Sunday. On Monday, NBC's telecast of the 64th annual Golden Globes led during every half-hour of the night and averaged 20 million viewers over all, that award show's highest ratings in three years. NBC fared less well Sunday as the second week of ''Grease: You're the One That I Want'' at 8 (8.2 million) and ''The Apprentice'' at 9 (7.3 million) fell to fourth place.</p>
