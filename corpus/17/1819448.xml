[C4.]</p>
        <p>COPY PROTECTION IS BROKEN -- A loose-knit coalition of hackers around the world defeated the antipiracy software protecting several high-resolution movies in the HD DVD format, a feat that could send the technology companies behind the new wave of advanced DVDs scrambling back to the drawing board to improve their copy protection.

        <p>COMMERCE BANCORP IN INQUIRY -- Commerce Bancorp, which calls itself ''America's most convenient bank,'' rattled investors with the disclosure that federal regulators were investigating the bank's real estate deals with executives. Critics have long complained about the Commerce Bancorp's business ties with firms that are either owned or controlled by Commerce's chairman and president, Vernon W.

        <p>SYMANTEC WARNED of disappointing third-quarter results and cut its full-year outlook, sending its shares down 12 percent as it blamed weak business software sales and higher-than-expected costs.

        <p>THE HOME BUILDER CENTEX Corporation said it expected to post a loss in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 because of softness in the housing market.
