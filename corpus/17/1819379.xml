        <p>Miriam Novalle had to close her T Salon on East 20th Street last summer when the lease ran out, but that obviously did not discourage her.</p>
        <p>She has replaced it with T Salon &amp; T Emporium, a large showroom on the fourth floor at 134 West 26th Street, top; Ms. Novalle is at left.</p>
        <p>Customers will find the same elaborate tea canisters and tea accessories and the more than 400 kinds of tea she sold before.</p>
        <p>Among them are a number of flower teas, above left, which burst into bloom in the teapot or a cup.</p>
        <p>With the help of new investors, she has also opened T Salon, which serves teas and tea-based snacks on the lower level of the sleekly modern TÃ© Casan shoe store at 382 West Broadway (Spring Street), above right.</p>
        <p>Ms. Novalle plans to open another T Salon in the Chelsea Market, 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street), in about eight weeks.</p>
        <p>It will have tea for sale, a full bar for tea-based cocktails, snacks developed by Allan Susser of Miami, and a machine that makes a satisfyingly frothy tea cappuccino at the touch of a button.</p>
