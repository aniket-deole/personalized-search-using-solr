        <p>HOLZWORTH--Jean, D.V.M., a long-time resident ar Lake Waramaug, New Preston, CT, died on January 13, 2007. Born March 26, 1915 in Port Chester, NY, she attended Greenwich Academy and Bryn Mawr College (A.B., M.A., and Pd.D. in Latin). A beloved cat's death in 1943 from panleukopenia, a lethal virus infection form which no vaccine then existed, turned her from teaching at Mount Holyoke College to veterinary school at Cornell. From 1950 to 1986 at the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital of the Massachusetts S.P.C.A in Boston, she specialized in caring for cats. Over several decades she and her colleagues published many studies of important feline disorders, most notably feline leukemia, feline infectious peritonitis and hyperthyroidism. Dr. Holzworth is survived by a niece, Betsy Gilliam Brown, of Princeton, NJ and a nephew, John Gilliam, of Newport, KY. Services are private. Contributions may be made to the Massachusettes S.P.C.A., Boston, MA 02130; Bryn Mawr College, Byrn Mawr, PA 19010; or Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine, Ithaca, NY 14853. Rowe Funeral Home, Litchfield, CT is in charge of the services.</p>
