        <p>With wintry days starting to bite back, cassoulet, the hearty southwestern French stew of white beans and preserved meats, is finally whetting appetites around town. Several restaurants have started serving this specialty.</p>
        <p>Among them are Savoy, below, 70 Prince Street (Crosby Street), where black iron crocks of cassoulet, made with the proper tarbais beans and a crust of crumbs, are tucked into the fireplaces. A generous portion made with duck confit, sausage, lamb and pork belly is $32 through Feb. 11: (212) 219-8570.</p>
