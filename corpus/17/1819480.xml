        <p>Whatever happened to drinking some O.J. and eating a slice of whole-wheat toast or a bowl of whole-grain cereal before venturing out for coffee? (''The Breakfast Wars,'' Jan. 10).</p>
        <p>Presumably we all know enough about the connection between diet and health to know that store-bought pastries and egg and cheese sandwiches are not the foundation of any healthy eating plan. More people are heavier than ever; Type 2 diabetes is on the rise; diet books are best sellers.</p>
        <p>The answer is simple. Really. Try eating at home. One could actually brew coffee at home, too, if needed. And sprinkle cinnamon on top.</p>
