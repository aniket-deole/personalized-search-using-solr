        <p>A winning combination of whimsy, fine craftsmanship and practical design distinguishes these fish servers from Jacaranda, a company in Cape Town. They are hand-forged from heavy silver plate with handles made of brass with copper inlays. The broad fish lifter is $175 and the fork is $115; the price for both is $280. All the items sold by Jacaranda are made by artisans; these are by Theresa Jo Wessels. They can be ordered from jacarandastyle.com or (800)985-5509.</p>
