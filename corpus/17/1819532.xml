        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday appointed Robert C. Lieber, a private-equity executive at Lehman Brothers, as president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, overseeing nearly 400 employees who try to develop city-owned real estate, help businesses, provide financial services and revitalize the waterfront and industrial neighborhoods. Mr. Lieber, 52, who starts on Feb. 1 and will be paid $189,720, was part of a group of Lehman Brothers volunteers who last year helped the city renegotiate the lease for the World Trade Center site, along with the state and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He succeeds Andrew M. Alper, who stepped down in June; Joshua J. Sirefman was interim president of the corporation from July until this month.</p>
