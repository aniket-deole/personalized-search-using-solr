        <p>City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. raised nearly $524,000 in the last six months, giving him a sizable lead in fund-raising among the potential 2009 mayoral candidates, according to campaign finance disclosures released yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, who has all but formally declared himself as a candidate to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has about $2.2 million on hand, including about $1.4 million left from the 2005 election, records show. That money could be used to mount a bid for mayor.</p>
        <p>The finance disclosures yielded few surprises. But with 38 City Council seats coming open because of term limits, Campaign Finance Board officials said they were seeing an increase in fund-raising compared with the same period in the 2005 election cycle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, a Brooklyn Democrat, was among 30 or so candidates who have filed campaign finance reports for the 2009 election, only a handful of whom have declared which office they will seek.</p>
        <p>Councilman Tony Avella, a Queens Democrat, is the only person who has declared himself a candidate for mayor, though he is seen as a long shot. He has raised $72,000, most of that in the last six months.</p>
        <p>The Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carri√≥n Jr., another Democrat considering a mayoral bid, had raised about $276,000 as of July 17, the last reporting period. His latest report was in the mail yesterday and had not been received by the Campaign Finance Board.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, who will lose his seat to term limits, has raised more than $329,000, about $195,000 of it in the last six months.</p>
        <p>Councilman John C. Liu, a Queens Democrat who has not declared which office he will seek, raised nearly $537,000 to lead all candidates in this reporting period, bringing his war chest to just over $1 million.</p>
        <p>The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, a Manhattan Democrat and another potential mayoral candidate, has raised about $201,000. She cannot run again for the Council because of term limits.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman James F. Brennan, a Brooklyn Democrat, has raised $209,574 in his bid to replace Mr. Thompson as city comptroller. He trails Councilman David I. Weprin, a Queens Democrat, who has raised $966,000.</p>
        <p>Eliot Spitzer's campaign for governor reported spending $2.65 million in the most recent filing period. According to his press secretary, Christine Anderson, the campaign spent $1.5 million on the governor's inauguration.</p>
