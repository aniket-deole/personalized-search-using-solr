        <p>Re ''Passing Exchange Becomes Political Flashpoint Focused on Feminism'' (news article, Jan. 13):</p>
        <p>The silliness resulting from Senator Barbara Boxer's comment to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- ''Who pays the price?'' -- is nothing more than that: silliness.</p>
        <p>Neither of these women has family members who are in the military waiting to be sent to Iraq or who are already there. That is a fact. It is the truth. It is not demeaning. It is not an attack. It is not antifeminist.</p>
        <p>This is wasted rhetoric and an absurdly ridiculous debate.</p>
        <p>Mary Ramniceanu  New York, Jan. 14, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Senator Barbara Boxer stepped over a line, but --  shouldn't there be a smidgen of awareness from someone in this administration that there is a singular lack of shared sacrifice in this war?</p>
        <p>And that the near total absence from combat of any relatives of the decision makers in this administration symbolizes that difference between this and past wars?</p>
        <p>The administration would have done better if it had acknowledged that fact and not merely descended to the obvious reference to feminism.</p>
        <p>Bruce A. McAllister  Palm Beach, Fla., Jan. 13, 2007</p>
