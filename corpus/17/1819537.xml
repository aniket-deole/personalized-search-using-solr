        <p>A federal investigation of Jeanine F. Pirro, the former Westchester County district attorney who lost her recent campaign to become New York's attorney general, has expanded to examine a bead jewelry business that Ms. Pirro set up several years ago, according to her spokesman, Michael R. Edelman. More than two dozen people have been asked to testify about the costume jewelry they purchased from Ms. Pirro. Mr. Edelman said yesterday that Ms. Pirro had planned to give the profits to charity but dissolved the business in 2004 after losing money. During the fall campaign, Ms. Pirro, a Republican, disclosed that she was the subject of a federal investigation into her talks with a former New York City police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, about plans to wiretap the family boat. Ms. Pirro said she had believed that her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., was having an affair. But she said she never went through with the eavesdropping plans and broke no law. ''If the best thing that the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, which is the No. 1 terrorist district in the world, has to do is look into a failed bead business, we've got a problem,'' Mr. Edelman said.</p>
