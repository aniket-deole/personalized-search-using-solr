        <p>The Austrian skier Hermann Maier, who knows a thing or two about bouncing back from injury, has offered encouragement to the Austrian-born governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who broke a leg last month on a skiing trip.</p>
        <p>''I wrote him a letter,'' Maier said in an interview Sunday. ''I told him I believe for sure he will have a great comeback.''</p>
        <p>In the late 1990s, Maier's aggressive skiing and seemingly indestructible body earned him the nickname the Herminator, a play on the title of Schwarzenegger's most famous action-movie character, the Terminator.</p>
        <p>Maier was already one of the greatest ski racers when he nearly lost a leg in a 2001 motorcycle accident. He then returned to the top of the sport two years later, winning skiing's most coveted trophies with a mellower, more reflective attitude.</p>
        <p>Now losing speed at 34, Maier has not said when he plans to retire. He won two medals last year at the Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, but this season has finished on the podium only once in 15 races on the World Cup circuit.</p>
        <p>He typically peaks for the annual Hahnenkamm race at Kitzb√ºhel, Austria, the most dangerous and celebrated downhill on the tour. That Jan. 27 event could be canceled as early as tomorrow if race officials decide there is not enough snow.</p>
        <p>With dirt showing through much of the course's lower section, organizers are importing snow from higher elevations with trucks and helicopters.</p>
        <p>Schwarzenegger, who broke his right femur Dec. 23 in Sun Valley, Idaho, is an avid skier. Maier has never skied with him, though he said he hoped to.</p>
