        <p>Sending legions of gamers around the world into a full-fledged tizzy, Blizzard Entertainment yesterday released the first retail expansion for World of Warcraft, the online computer role-playing game that has reshaped the electronic entertainment industry by attracting more than 8 million paying subscribers. The expansion, known as the Burning Crusade, is expected to be one of this year's top-selling games and may confirm World of Warcraft's perch atop the online gaming sector, one of the fastest-growing segments of the entertainment economy. World of Warcraft has been the first American video game to achieve truly global success. Most players pay around $15 a month for access to the game, which means it is on pace to take in more than $1 billion in subscription revenue this year. Online games like World of Warcraft are regularly updated by their makers through software upgrades known as patches. But the Burning Crusade is World of Warcraft's first full expansion, which must be purchased at retail (for $40). Players who do not upgrade can continue to play the game, but will not have access to the new features included in Burning Crusade.</p>
