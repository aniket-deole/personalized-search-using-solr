        <p>Correction of Jan 6 article on finding new White House counsel; Judge Laurence H Silberman has senior status but is not retired</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Jan. 6 about White House efforts to find a new chief counsel misstated the working status of Laurence H. Silberman of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who was considered a contender for the job. On Nov. 1, 2000, he took senior status, which allows a judge to continue to serve while handling fewer cases than a judge in active service; he has not retired. (President Bush has since named Fred F. Fielding to be the White House counsel.)</p>
