        <p>DUDELHEIM--Hans. The New School deeply mourns the passing of Hans Dudelheim, a beloved member of the film production faculty since 1996, who died of injuries sustained in a motorbike accident in Puerto Rico on January 4th. Hans was an award-winning (Emmy, CINE Golden Eagle) film editor with a distinguished professional career as well as a master teacher of 16mm film production and editing. His patience and devotion to students was legendary within the film program, and he will be greatly missed by all who were lucky enough to cross his path.
