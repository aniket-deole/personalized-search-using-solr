        <p>OPENING THIS WEEK</p>
        <p>CAFFE FALAI -- The latest venture of Iacopo Falai, below, melds the white tile of his original place, Falai on Clinton Street, with more rustic touches. The menu at the new place, which is to open tomorrow in SoHo, is familiar, too, with dishes like baby octopus, potatoes and black olives or branzino with brussels sprouts and tomato confit. The panini and salads echo the offerings of his Falai Panetteria. The new place will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Customers can bring their own wine and beer. Dinner hours will be extended in the spring: 265 Lafayette Street (Prince Street), (917) 338-6207.</p>
        <p>HAVANA CENTRAL AT THE WEST END -- The finishing touches are just about done on the $2.5 million renovation of the West End, the venerable Morningside Heights bar and jazz club. It combines design and culinary elements from the Havana Central restaurants in Midtown and Union Square, and it is to open on Friday: 2911 Broadway (113th Street), (212) 662-8830.</p>
        <p>OPEN NOW</p>
        <p>CHILIES &amp; CHOCOLATE OAXACAN KITCHEN -- This Mexican spot specializes in moles. You can order a fried grasshopper to nibble with your tequila: 54 Seventh Avenue (Lincoln Place), Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-7700.</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN BURGER BAR -- Minnow and Bar Minnow are now owned by Greg Murjani, who has turned them into a burger bar, with eight varieties, including one finished in Brooklyn Beer. There are also fried calamari, barbecued shrimp, fish and chips and salads: 444 Ninth Street (Seventh Avenue), Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-5500.</p>
        <p>FUNKY DINER -- A selection of creamy gelati greets customers at this new Upper West Side spot, where burgers, eggs, potatoes, sandwiches, crepes and waffles, soda fountain drinks and fancy cheeses, imported beers and wines are on the menu: 466 Columbus Avenue (82nd Street), (212) 873-0600.</p>
        <p>67 BURGER -- This new spot offers 11 varieties, anchored by beef, turkey and vegetarian, in a setting that fuses diner and industrial: 67 Lafayette Avenue (South Elliott Place), Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 797-7150.</p>
        <p>LOOKING AHEAD</p>
        <p>BACK FORTY -- Peter Hoffman, who owns Savoy, and Jerry Winter, one of his managers, plan to open a tavern with a garden in April: 190 Avenue B (12th Street).</p>
        <p>CHEFS ON THE MOVE</p>
        <p>MARK ANDELBRADT has left as chef de cuisine at Morimoto for the same job at Tao in Las Vegas. Dale Talde, the sous-chef, is acting chef de cuisine.</p>
        <p>CLOSED</p>
        <p>BARÇA 18 -- Stephen Hanson has closed this Spanish place, a collaboration with Eric Ripert: 225 Park Avenue South (18th Street).</p>
