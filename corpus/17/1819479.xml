        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One important bit of information Marian Burros did not discuss in her article ''Hot Stuff'' (Jan. 10) was how much heat silicone can endure. Most products state a range of temperatures. However, none I have seen state a warning that products not be used under the broiler.</p>
        <p>We had an oven fire due to browning a piece of pastry that had been baked on a silicone liner. The baking part was fine, and to brown under the broiler, we just left the silicone mat under the pastry. But that resulted in an oven fire within less than a minute.</p>

        <p>Although we had no fire extinguisher at hand, the fire burned itself out within five minutes. But it left us with a stove that needed replacing and a kitchen that needed complete cleaning and painting.</p>
        <p>Please alert readers that a broiler reaches temperatures much above the usual upper limits of silicone cookware.</p>
