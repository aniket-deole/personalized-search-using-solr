        <p>The derailment of a tanker car containing about 30,000 gallons of propane on a section of railroad track in Maspeth yesterday prompted the evacuation of about 150 people from homes and businesses, fire officials said. The tanker car, attached to nine others, each containing equal amounts of propane, was being backed up when it derailed, hitting another car stopped on the track behind it, they said. Though no leak occurred, the police, Fire Department and Office of Emergency Management worked throughout the day to secure the derailed car and by evening were awaiting the arrival of cranes from Pennsylvania to lift the car back onto the tracks, fire officials said. It was unclear last night when the people who live and work near the site, at Metropolitan Avenue and Fresh Pond Road, would be allowed to return to their homes and businesses.</p>
