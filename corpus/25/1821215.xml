        <p>IN recent years, the promise of untracked powder snow has lured more and more skiers and snowboarders from resorts into the adjacent backcountry. Even for a short jaunt, they may take extra layers, food, water and avalanche-safety gear like beacons, collapsible shovels and probes. To carry it all, manufacturers now design ski- and snowboard-specific packs.</p>
        <p>''More people are wanting packs that they can comfortably ski with rather than just a regular day pack,'' said Bob Merrill, a buyer for Backcountry.com, an outdoor retailer.</p>

        <p>''More people are wanting packs that they can comfortably ski with rather than just a regular day pack,'' said Bob Merrill, a buyer for Backcountry.com, an outdoor retailer.</p>
        <p>The latest winter packs come with sleeves for hydration pouches, added compartments for gear and better suspension systems that more evenly distribute loads. The design of ski and board straps has also improved, so equipment doesn't uncomfortably bounce, hang or hit legs when hiking.</p>
        <p>Erik Aura and Martinique Davis, ski patrollers for Telluride Ski Resort in Colorado, tested five packs while skiing and hiking in backcountry.</p>
