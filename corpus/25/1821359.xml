        <p>Tom Waits, below, has settled his lawsuit against the carmaker Adam Opel AG and a German advertising agency over television commercials that he says mimicked his vocal style without his permission. The ads, made two years ago by McCann Erickson Germany for Opel, a division of General Motors, showed car owners putting their vehicles away to the sounds of a gravelly, Waitsian lullaby. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but in a statement Mr. Waits -- who has successfully sued advertisers in the past for copying his sound -- said he would donate his net proceeds to charity. According to the statement, McCann Erickson said, ''We respect Mr. Waits and deeply regret any embarrassment this may have caused.'' Mr. Waits said, ''I'm glad to be out of the car sales business once and for all.''</p>
