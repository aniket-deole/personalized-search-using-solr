        <p>On the night of President Bush's State of the Union address, the ''American Idol'' judges kicked off prime time in Memphis with imposing ratings as usual. According to Nielsen's estimates, which do not account for time zone discrepancies due to interruptions for the president's live speech, the series yielded 31.2 million viewers in the 8 p.m. hour Tuesday, significantly ahead of second place ''NCIS'' on CBS (14.3 million). As a result, Fox retained a substantial lead going into State of the Union programming at 9. Ratings for the 49-minute address weren't immediately available, but preliminary approximations show Fox's coverage on top, followed by NBC and CBS in a close race for second, and ABC in fourth. On Sunday, ''Ocean's Deadliest,'' the documentary Steve Irwin was filming when he was killed, attracted 3.2 million viewers. It was carried on two cable channels, Discovery (1.7 million) and Animal Planet (1.5 million), from 8 p.m. to 9:30.</p>
