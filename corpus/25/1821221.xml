        <p>If you like to work both sitting and standing -- or can't decide what table height suits you best -- the new GO-2 desk may be perfect for you. Manufactured by Leuwico, a German company, and distributed in the United States by Topdeq, it has an electronic height adjustment system. With the push of a button, the desktop can be quickly adjusted to any height between 27 and 46 1/2 inches. An optional cable spirals down the side of the desk, neatly containing the wiring. The desk is made of gray powder-coated steel and comes in two sizes and various finishes -- from light beech melamine to an industrial-looking gray melamine. Desks start at $1,345; topdeq.com or (866) 876-3300.</p>
