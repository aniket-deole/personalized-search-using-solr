        <p>Robert Riggio of Manhattan, who was charged with defrauding more than 60 priests over several years, pleaded guilty to wire fraud in Federal District Court yesterday, prosecutors said. Mr. Riggio, 60, faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced in April, said Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Garcia said that Mr. Riggio stole more than $200,000 from 2004 to 2006 by calling priests with bogus pleas for help and requests for money. The funds often came from the priests' personal savings, Mr. Garcia said. Mr. Riggio was arrested in September after he asked for money from an F.B.I. agent posing as the niece of a priest who had been defrauded, Mr. Garcia said.</p>
