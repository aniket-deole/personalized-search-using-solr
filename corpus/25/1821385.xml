        <p>''This may be the greatest movie ever made,'' Errol Morris said upon seeing ''Decasia,'' the experimental work by the filmmaker Bill Morrison and the composer Michael Gordon. An ''ineffably beautiful and heartbreaking study of the poetics of disintegrating film stock,'' it features fading images from old silver-nitrate films; when they dissolve before your eyes, the effect is equal parts psychedelic '60s light show and post-post-modern cinema. And it's even better with live accompaniment, Allan Kozinn says. The score for this symphony of decay ''evolves from a faint, metallic rattle to an insistent but pointed rhythm pattern to a pounding, syncopated, clangorous barrage.'' Tonight's all-too-rare performance is in a crumbling former synagogue -- a fitting setting indeed.</p>
        <p>Tonight through Saturday at 7 and 9:30 p.m., Angel Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, at Houston Street, (212) 352-3101, $25.</p>
