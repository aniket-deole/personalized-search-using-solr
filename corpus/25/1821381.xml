        <p>Tony Sexton, 37, of Jamaica, was convicted of second-degree murder yesterday in State Supreme Court for killing Maria Rogers, 57, his fiancée's mother, in 2003, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said that Ms. Rogers objected to Mr. Sexton's moving into her home, and that after an argument on Feb. 14, 2003, Mr. Sexton bludgeoned her to death. He said Mr. Sexton then put her body in a garbage bag, placed the bag in her car and abandoned the vehicle about a mile away. Mr. Sexton faces up to 27 years in prison when he is sentenced next month, Mr. Brown said.</p>
