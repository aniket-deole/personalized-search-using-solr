        <p>Domingo Changes His Tune</p>
        <p>The tenor Plácido Domingo, below, will turn baritone when he sings the title role in Verdi's ''Simon Boccanegra'' for the first time, in 2009 at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin, The Associated Press reported. A spokesman for Mr. Domingo said the singer, who turned 66 on Monday, has also agreed to sing the role at La Scala in Milan and the Royal Opera in London. In April 2005 while discussing retirement, Mr. Domingo said that he wanted to sing ''Simon Boccanegra'' before leaving the stage. At the Metropolitan Opera at 8 tonight, Mr. Domingo will give the 3,300th operatic performance of his career, in the season's final performance of Tan Dun's ''First Emperor.''</p>
        <p>Japanese Nationalists Prepare Nanjing Film</p>
        <p>Japanese nationalists plan to produce a film on the massacre known as the Rape of Nanking to contradict a series of films to be released this year, its 70th anniversary, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. The nationalists' film, tentatively titled ''The Truth of Nanjing,'' as the city is now called, will be directed by Satoru Mizushima, who heads a nationalist television channel. Flanked by dozens of supporters, including members of parliament, he said, ''If we remain silent, anti-Japanese propaganda will spread across the world.'' Chinese historians say some 300,000 civilians died in an orgy of murder, rape and destruction by Japanese troops in the city in 1937. Allied trials of Japanese war criminals put the number of dead at 140,000. Some Japanese historians maintain that the toll was less or deny the massacre, saying the dead were soldiers, not civilians.</p>
