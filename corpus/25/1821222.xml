      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For centuries, kimonos were decorated with patterns using paper stencils called katagami, made from three layers of rice paper and treated with persimmon juice. The technique is now a dying art, but Hiromi Ishii, an artist in Tokyo, has found a way to resurrect the one-of-a-kind stencils -- as paper lanterns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ishii takes stencils dating from the late 19th century to the 1940s, backs them with new rice paper and attaches them to iron frames wired to hold 25-watt bulbs. The katagami lights are manufactured in two shapes: rectangular and cylindrical. The rectangular lanterns come in 18-inch and 24-inch versions (the smaller, below, is $1,300), and the cylindrical ones are 18 inches high (above, $1,300). Prices range from $1,300 to $1,500.
