        <p>THE most ordinary household objects -- even drawer pulls or measuring cups -- can seem exotic when they are purchased in a foreign marketplace. But not everyone has time to travel, so some stores are bringing the bazaar concept home, setting up their own versions of souks. Many of the bazaars are temporary, and the merchandise is carried in limited quantities -- when it is sold out, that's it.</p>
        <p>Target's Global Bazaar runs through Feb. 17. Furnishings from 22 countries -- including Thailand, Italy, China and Peru -- are available in the company's stores and, in some cases, online; target.com or (800) 440-0680.</p>
        <p>1. A beaded vase ($39.99) and jar ($34.99) are from China.  2. A large basket ($39.99) and a smaller one ($19.99) are also from China.  3. A weathered two-drawer jewelry box is made in Peru of wood ($59.99).</p>
        <p>Circa Trade, in the Hudson Supermarket in Hudson, N.Y., sells furnishings from countries like India, China, Uzbekistan, Burma and the Philippines. (Courtney Pyle, the owner, had a similar shop in Pune, India, in the late 1990s.) Furniture and accessories can be purchased at 310 Warren Street in Hudson; for information: (212) 656-1378 or circatrade.com.</p>
        <p>4. A quilted throw made of antique Indian saris is $360, and a wood santos figure from the Philippines is $6,500.  5. A carved wood, horned mask from Burma is $980.  6. Ceramic drawer pulls from India are $2 to $4.</p>
        <p>The Conran Shop has assembled 170 ordinary home products, new and vintage, in a collection called ''Everyday Domestic Products From Around the World.'' From today through Feb. 25, items from places including France, India, Wales, Austria and Syria will be displayed at the store under tarps, as if in an outdoor market: 407 East 59th Street; (866) 755-9079 or conranusa.com.</p>
        <p>7. A powder-coated steel stacking chair from France is $195 in white, red or silver.  8. A cone-shaped tin measuring cup from England is $18.  9. Vintage wool blankets from Wales, in different plaids and various sizes, are $175 to $190.  10. Buckets of assorted sizes made in Syria of recycled automotive tires can organize magazines ($135) or small desk items ($18).</p>
