      <abstract>
        <p>China's big eastern cities are scrambling to find ways to comply with law passed in 2003 ordering local governments to provide public school education for all children under their jurisdictions, including 20 million children of laborers from rural China who migrated to cities for work; these laborers have been deprived of right of their children to attend public schools, a legacy of Maoist times; many migrants have turned to private schools, many of them unlicensed and substandard; Beijing has closed down some private schools, while in Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, city has been buying out private schools and converting them into public schools; other cities are said to be extending technical assistance to migrant schools, trying to bring them up to acceptable standards; photos (M)</p>

        <p>In a rare response to a criminal incident, China's president, Hu Jintao, has ordered a speedy investigation into the killing of a journalist who was beaten to death recently while investigating conditions in an illegal coal mine, the semiofficial China News Service reported on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The killing of the journalist, Lan Chengzhang, a reporter for the newspaper China Trade News, drew widespread protests from reporters in China and media advocacy groups abroad. Mr. Lan was attacked on Jan. 10, along with a colleague, when they went to interview the owner of the mine, near the northern city of Datong, in Shanxi Province. Seven people have been detained so far in the incident, and three others are still being sought, according to published reports.</p>

        <p>In a rare response to a criminal incident, China's president, Hu Jintao, has ordered a speedy investigation into the killing of a journalist who was beaten to death recently while investigating conditions in an illegal coal mine, the semiofficial China News Service reported on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The killing of the journalist, Lan Chengzhang, a reporter for the newspaper China Trade News, drew widespread protests from reporters in China and media advocacy groups abroad. Mr. Lan was attacked on Jan. 10, along with a colleague, when they went to interview the owner of the mine, near the northern city of Datong, in Shanxi Province. Seven people have been detained so far in the incident, and three others are still being sought, according to published reports.</p>
        <p>Citing government officials, the China News Service said that Mr. Hu and other senior Communist Party officials had sent instructions ''demanding that the case be rapidly investigated and the results be reported as quickly as possible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lan and his colleague, Chang Hanwen, were set upon by as many as 20 attackers on the way to an interview with the mine owner, Hou Zhenrun, who has been accused of organizing the attack. Mr. Lan died of what appeared to be a brain hemorrhage. Mr. Chang's right arm was broken and his body badly bruised, according to a statement published by China Trade News.</p>
        <p>The local police have been quoted in Chinese news reports as saying that Mr. Lan was suspected of seeking out the mine owner to blackmail him, offering not to publish reports about the mine in exchange for money. Chinese journalists have criticized such speculation, calling it no justification for the attack.</p>
        <p>China's coal mining industry is the deadliest in the world, with 4,746 workers killed in job-related accidents in 2006, and the government has been pushing to enforce safety standards and close illegal mines.</p>
