        <p>A man was killed and a woman seriously injured yesterday afternoon in a shooting in the South Ward, the authorities said. Police officers responding to a report of shots fired around 3:15 p.m. on Shaw Avenue near Route 78 found a 23-year-old man dead near a tan sport utility vehicle, said Judy Gagliano, an assistant prosecutor with the Essex County prosecutor's office. A woman nearby, who had been shot several times, was taken to University Hospital, where she was in critical condition last night. Neither was identified yesterday. The homicide was Newark's 10th this year.</p>
