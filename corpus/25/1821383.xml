        <p>A woman died in a house fire early yesterday despite her husband's efforts to save her, said Jeff Cartwright, director of the Essex County prosecutor's arson task force. Prosecutors would not identify the woman, but neighbors said the single-family house at 60 Montclair Avenue belonged to Nick Fierro, 79, and his wife, Marge, 73. Mr. Cartwright said the fire was not considered suspicious. The woman's husband was treated for smoke inhalation at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge and released, a spokeswoman said.</p>
