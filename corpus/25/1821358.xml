        <p>In the closest race for No. 1 since the company SoundScan began tracking music sales 16 years ago, the ''American Idol'' alumnus Chris Daughtry's debut album edged out the ''Dreamgirls'' soundtrack by about 130 copies, Billboard reported. But in the third straight week of dismal CD sales, nobody was a big winner. Mr. Daughtry's album, ''Daughtry'' (RCA), which has been bubbling through the Top 10 since it was released in November, reached the top of the chart with about 65,000 sales, followed closely by ''Dreamgirls'' (Sony). Another soundtrack, to the Disney Channel movie ''Jump In!'' (Disney), is at No. 3 with 57,000. After an appearance on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' last week, the British soul singer Corinne Bailey Rae jumped 28 spots to No. 4, with sales of 55,000 copies of her self-titled album on Capitol.</p>
