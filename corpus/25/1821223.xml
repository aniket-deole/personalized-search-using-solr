        <p>Tribbles Home and Garden is a family-run general store with a 21st-century sensibility. Two sisters, Cara Stone-Pfeifer, 46, an interior designer, and Elizabeth Rad, 48, a real estate developer, conceived the home-and-garden supply shop, which they opened in TriBeCa last month, as an alternative to a big-box superstore. Their goal, said Ms. Stone-Pfeifer, below left, was ''to take the anxiety out of shopping by offering the single best and most functional things in every category of home accessories.''</p>
        <p>The merchandise they carry includes ipe wood shelves with a mahogany finish designed by Ms. Stone-Pfeifer (starting at $275) and orchid flower arrangements ($145), top right; all-purpose white porcelain plates ($11 each), center right, on a wooden serving tray ($45), both by Guy Degrenne; and, bottom right, a hand-blown glass vase from Portugal ($80). In addition to kitchen, bath and garden accessories and furniture, Tribbles also offers architectural, interior and floral design services; 217 West Broadway (Franklin Street), (212) 965-8480.</p>
