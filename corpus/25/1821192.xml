        <p>GLABMAN--Sheldon, M.D. April 13, 1932-January 23, 2007. A man of enormous intelligence, compassion, charm and wit. He loved wine, women, song and fly fishing, though not necessarily in that order. A Physician dedicated to the Art of Medicine. He is survived by his children Meridith (Rocco), Jim Bob, Leslie (Steven), and his grandchildren, Danielle and Samantha. A devoted and beloved friend who will be dearly missed. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the International Vocal Arts Institute, Inc.</p>
        <p>$(6$)GLABMAN--Sheldon, M.D. To the world you were the smartest, to us you were the best, we miss you. Betty Weinstein and Susan Swatzburg.</p>
        <p>$(6$)GLABMAN--Dr. Sheldon. My big brother, I will miss your wise counsel and your guiding hand on my back. With all our love we say goodbye. Jeanee, Jeff, and Meredith</p>
        <p>$(6$)GLABMAN--Dr. Sheldon. Our cherished Doctor and dear friend of thirty years, we extend our deepest sympathy to the entire Glabman family, and his devoted assistant, Susan. Our hearts are broken. The Wallerstein Family</p>
        <p>$(6$)GLABMAN--Sheldon. The Samuel Bronfman Department of medicine of the Mount Sinai Medical Center is saddened by the passing of Sheldon Glabman, M.D. A superb clinician, his patients and colleagues were fortunate to have the opportunity to benefit from his expertise. Our sincere sympathy is extended to his family and friends. Paul Klotman, M.D. Chair, Dept of Medicine Barbara Murphy, M.D. Chief, Division of Nephrology</p>
        <p>$(6$)GLABMAN--Sheldon M.D. Sheldon we loved you, you were the best! Kandy Singer Mel Geller</p>
        <p>$(6$)GLABMAN--Dr. Sheldon. Dear Shelly, who has always been there for us, you are irreplaceable. We will miss you always. Love, Sherwin, Jackie, Jonny, Donna, Barrie, Adam, Nicole, Andrew, Jeffrey and Tucker.</p>
        <p>$(6$)GLABMAN--SHELDON, MD The Association of the Attending Staff of the Mount Sinai Hospital deeply mourns the passing of our long-standing colleague, mentor, and friend. Consummate nephrologist and internist, Dr. Glabman came to Mount Sinai almost 50 years ago, training generations of medical students and residents in dialysis and all aspects of renal disease. He was a recipient of the prestigious Jacobi Medallion award in 1997. From 1995-1996, he served as AAS President, leading the physicians through challenging times in health care policy. He was a quiet voice of reason. Dr. Glabman was a lover of words, music, ballet, opera, fly-fishing, fine wine, sports, and most especially, the people in his life. We will always remember his understated intelligence and his loyalty to this institution. We extend our sincere condolences to his entire family. Vicki Lopachin, MD President Thomas McGinn, MD Vice-President Amy Weinstein Administrator</p>
