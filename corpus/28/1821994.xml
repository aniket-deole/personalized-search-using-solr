        <p>Homemade fresh mozzarella ($7 a pound) is the big attraction at Massimo Italian Delicatessen in Kenilworth. ''I make it at least twice a day,'' said Massimo Clemente, known as Max. ''We also prepare our own marinara sauce'' ($4.25 a quart, plain; $4.50 with meat).</p>
        <p>There are homemade sausages hanging from stainless-steel hooks. Hand-hewn wooden bins are filled with fresh-dried pastas like cavatelli, spaghetti and fettuccine ($2.50 a pound).</p>
        <p>Prepared foods include hearty Italian classics, mostly sold frozen: sausage, peppers and onions ($6 a pound); stuffed shells ($4); ravioli ($5); lasagna ($6); and manicotti with meat sauce ($6).</p>
        <p>Customers arrive with coolers to fill with roasted peppers and marinated mushrooms ($6 a pound), imported sun-dried tomatoes ($8.99), olives ($5), and cheeses from Italy like Locatelli Romano ($8.99) and Parmigiano Reggiano ($14). Others stop for a wedge of Asiago cheese, which they grate over pasta or just eat with crackers ($8.99).</p>
        <p>Although he has been the deli's sole owner for three years, Mr. Clemente was previously a partner for more than 30 years. ''We've been doing the same thing since Day One,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some add Gorgonzola ($8.99 a pound) and fresh mascarpone cheese ($8 a pound) to their pasta; others eat sliced provolone ($10.99) with fresh pears.</p>
        <p>''Our customers seem to buy the same thing week after week,'' said John Finamore, a member of the staff who has been serving the public for 20 years. Favorites include the imported meats: soppressata (imported dried Italian salami, $10 a pound), mortadella (Italian bologna, $6), capicola (cured salami, $10) and, of course, prosciutto ($14).</p>
        <p>Sandwiches are a big attraction, like the one with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, capicola and roasted peppers, drizzled with balsamic vinegar on a roll ($5). Shelves are filled with spices, sauces and condiments. You can also pick up everything from a loaf of bread to a box of Perugina chocolates (28 pieces, $18.75).</p>
        <p>Massimo Italian Delicatessen, 532 Boulevard, Kenilworth; (908) 276-1500. Hours: Tuesday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sunday, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
