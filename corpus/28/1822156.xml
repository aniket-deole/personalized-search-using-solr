        <p>At least 14 people were killed, most of them policemen, and several others were wounded Saturday in what appeared to be a suicide bombing here shortly before a Shiite religious procession was to come through, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said the incident occurred in the old part of Peshawar, the capital of North-West Frontier Province, late in the evening, as police and city workers were clearing a narrow street near a Shiite mosque to make way for the procession. Among the dead were the city police chief, Malik Muhammad Saad, and several government representatives from the neighborhood, the police said.</p>

        <p>At least 14 people were killed, most of them policemen, and several others were wounded Saturday in what appeared to be a suicide bombing here shortly before a Shiite religious procession was to come through, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said the incident occurred in the old part of Peshawar, the capital of North-West Frontier Province, late in the evening, as police and city workers were clearing a narrow street near a Shiite mosque to make way for the procession. Among the dead were the city police chief, Malik Muhammad Saad, and several government representatives from the neighborhood, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said they believed the attack was by a lone suicide bomber who detonated his explosives after being stopped by a police cordon at the mouth of the street. The remains of a person the police thought was the bomber had been sent for forensic analysis, and the search for more evidence continued, said Ghulam Muhammad, a police official in the city.</p>
        <p>The Edhi Foundation, a charity group that runs ambulance services, said it had taken at least 14 bodies to a local hospital, where people had thronged to give blood donations for the wounded.</p>
        <p>The explosion also damaged the local power network, plunging the entire area into darkness as police and local volunteers searched for the dead and wounded.</p>
        <p>Security in Peshawar was already on alert after a suicide bombing outside a Marriott hotel in Islamabad on Friday and in preparation for Ashura, one of Shiite Islam's holiest days.</p>
        <p>But the leader of the province's religious government, Akram Khan Durrani, told reporters that precautions would be further increased.</p>
        <p>Still, the police said there was little any one could do to head off a determined suicide bomber.</p>
        <p>''How do you know who is the suicide bomber among a multitude of people?'' a policeman said at the scene.</p>
