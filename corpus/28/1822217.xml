        <p>When Martha Slater received a registered letter from the Town of Stonington two weeks ago, she guessed that it was probably about the playhouse that she and her husband, Alex, bought in June 2005 for their daughter, Chloe, when she turned 10.</p>
        <p>After all, the town had sent the Slaters a violation notice last year, calling the playhouse a shed that violated zoning regulations and ordering them to remove it. The Slaters, though, were under the impression that there would be no fines while they tried to work out a solution with town officials.</p>

        <p>When Martha Slater received a registered letter from the Town of Stonington two weeks ago, she guessed that it was probably about the playhouse that she and her husband, Alex, bought in June 2005 for their daughter, Chloe, when she turned 10.</p>
        <p>After all, the town had sent the Slaters a violation notice last year, calling the playhouse a shed that violated zoning regulations and ordering them to remove it. The Slaters, though, were under the impression that there would be no fines while they tried to work out a solution with town officials.</p>
        <p>But that changed when the letter informed them that they owed $54,450 for failing to remove the 48-square-foot structure.</p>
        <p>''I was shocked,'' Ms. Slater said. ''I had no warning they were going to fine me.''</p>
        <p>Before the Slaters bought the blue-and-white playhouse, they said town officials told them that they did not need a permit. But the town's zoning officer, Joe Larkin, said he envisioned the kind of plastic playhouse people buy at department stores, not a $2,200 wooden structure with windows, furniture and a fenced-in deck.</p>
        <p>The Slaters applied for a permit and a zoning variance but were denied. They said they were under the impression that the town would not carry out the $150-a-day fine while they tried to work out a solution. That was until the registered letter arrived assessing them for 363 days.</p>
        <p>William S. Brown, Stonington's first selectman, said the town would rescind the fine if the Slaters remove the playhouse. ''We don't want their money,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We just want them to be in compliance.''</p>
        <p>The Slaters say they cannot afford the fine and will remove the playhouse if they are not successful in their appeal, which is scheduled to be heard on Feb. 8.</p>
        <p>''I've prepared Chloe that we may have to move it,'' Ms. Slater said. ''I told her that sometimes life is unfair and you have to let things go.''</p>
