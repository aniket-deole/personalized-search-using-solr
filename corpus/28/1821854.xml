        <p>DORAN--Richard A. The Curtis Institute of Music mourns the loss of Richard A. Doran, longtime supporter and member of its Board of Trustees who served as chairman from June 2003 to June 2006. In his long association with the Institute, its students were uppermost among his concerns. He cultivated a personal connection to the young musicians at Curtis, including renowned pianist Lang Lang, and took a particular interest in their daily lives and their careers after graduation. Having enjoyed a long and distinguished career in political and corporate circles, Mr. Doran played a key role in the formation of the Curtis Business and Professional Associates, serving as its founding chairman from 1996 to 2003. He was dearly loved, and his enthusiastic dedication to Curtis will always be remembered. H.F. (Gerry) Lenfest, Chairman Roberto Diaz, President The Curtis Institute of Music</p>
