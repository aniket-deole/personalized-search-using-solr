        <p>Two Americans, including an elderly woman, were shot to death on Saturday afternoon by carjackers in Nairobi, the capital, according to American and Kenyan officials.</p>
        <p>The two victims, relatives of an American Embassy employee, were traveling in an embassy car with three other Americans when a truck cut them off, police officials said. Four men jumped out with Kalashnikov assault rifles and ordered the occupants out of their car.</p>
        <p>''Apparently, the driver and an elderly woman sitting in front did not move fast enough,'' a police spokesman said. ''So the bandits shot them.''</p>
        <p>Nairobi has been plagued by violent crime, and American officials said they did not believe the attack was related to terrorism.</p>
