        <p>Mark Mahan, 74, a retired college textbook sales manager from Columbus, Ohio: ''I was in the military for four years, in Germany and France and Belgium and the Netherlands. My wife and I have been to China, to Italy a couple of times, to Greece. I had never been to Yellowstone. My wife says, 'We travel to all these places around the world, and there's so much beauty here in the United States.' I was sitting in the front row, and the geyser made three or four phony starts and then it really blew off. We got snowed in that night. There was only one exit out of the park and you couldn't travel on it. But you could travel inside the park. That gave us an extra day, so we went back to see this thing about three more times.''</p>
