        <p>The Town of Oyster Bay is beginning a new effort to protect its waterfront, announcing intentions to create a master plan for the eastern waterfront in the hamlet of Oyster Bay.</p>
        <p>Using a $37,250 matching grant from the state's Environmental Protection Fund, the town hired a consultant to oversee the plan and appointed a steering committee, composed of representatives from local governments as well as environmental, civic and community groups.</p>
        <p>The eastern waterfront includes commercial, residential and town property. The study will address issues like improving public access and establishing connections between downtown and the community; providing easier public access to the waterfront and the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Park and Beach; and providing easier access for transient boaters to downtown.</p>
        <p>John Venditto, the town supervisor, said the plan was ''the last piece of a puzzle'' to protect the area's environmental resources and preserve the community character with sensible economic growth. He said that in the past 10 years the town had received $8.5 million in grants from the state for studies and work on waterfront projects -- a western waterfront plan and an Oyster Bay hamlet plan.</p>
        <p>The western waterfront plan includes a 9/11 memorial park, a new fishing pier and the eventual replacement of two buildings at a shipyard that were razed. The hamlet plan includes new street lighting and paving and redesigned storefronts.</p>
