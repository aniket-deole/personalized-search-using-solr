        <p>One of winter's luxuries is a sweet, seedless navel orange. But this month in California, where most of the nation's eating oranges are grown, navels met with a killing frost. Although West Coast citrus will be fleetingly available as the last survivors are shipped, orange eaters will have to look beyond the Golden State for their vitamin C.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be tricky,'' said Richard Thorpe, the produce buyer for Whole Foods markets in New England. ''Retailers will turn to Florida, and prices will go up across the board.'' Florida citrus, he added, is sometimes ''a little rougher'' in appearance than the unblemished fruit from California, something that consumers will have to get used to.</p>

        <p>One of winter's luxuries is a sweet, seedless navel orange. But this month in California, where most of the nation's eating oranges are grown, navels met with a killing frost. Although West Coast citrus will be fleetingly available as the last survivors are shipped, orange eaters will have to look beyond the Golden State for their vitamin C.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be tricky,'' said Richard Thorpe, the produce buyer for Whole Foods markets in New England. ''Retailers will turn to Florida, and prices will go up across the board.'' Florida citrus, he added, is sometimes ''a little rougher'' in appearance than the unblemished fruit from California, something that consumers will have to get used to.</p>
        <p>In addition to the usual juice oranges and grapefruit, Mr. Thorpe will be scouting red navels, honey tangerines, royal mandarins and Minneola tangelos (also sold as Honeybells). The brilliant orange Minneola, a hybrid of the Dancy tangerine and Duncan grapefruit, is particularly sweet, and an easy peeler for lunch boxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thorpe is also shopping abroad. ''Moroccan clementines this year are fantastic,'' he said. ''They're cheaper than California clementines because they're loaded on large ocean vessels, and bulk freight lowers our landed prices.''</p>
        <p>Oranges, no matter their country of origin, lend themselves to maceration, or soaking in their own sugared juice. Red navels, with their prom-pink flesh, make a particularly cheerful winter dessert. Using a sharp knife, peel the rind and membrane from the oranges; slice or section them, remove any seeds, toss with a heaping teaspoon of sugar per orange, and refrigerate for a few hours. (You can even add juice from an extra orange or two.) Serve straight up, or with vanilla ice cream.</p>
