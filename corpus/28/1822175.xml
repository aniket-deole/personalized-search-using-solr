        <p>Transit officials announced the formation of a task force yesterday to improve safety along unfenced tracks on the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road.</p>
        <p>The officials were joined at a news conference in Long Island City, Queens, by City Councilman Eric N. Gioia and by Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who announced $500,000 in federal financing to aid in the effort. Mr. Weiner also promised to introduce legislation to seek $20 million that communities could request to build fences along tracks.</p>

        <p>Transit officials announced the formation of a task force yesterday to improve safety along unfenced tracks on the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road.</p>
        <p>The officials were joined at a news conference in Long Island City, Queens, by City Councilman Eric N. Gioia and by Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who announced $500,000 in federal financing to aid in the effort. Mr. Weiner also promised to introduce legislation to seek $20 million that communities could request to build fences along tracks.</p>
        <p>He said the bill would be called ''Ari's Law'' after Ari Kraft, 13, a Queens junior high student killed by a Long Island Rail Road train on Jan. 5 while painting graffiti on elevated tracks in Rego Park.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority oversees the two railroads, which comprise more than 244 stations and 1,400 miles of track, only a small portion of which is fenced.</p>
        <p>The goals of the task force include finding ways to improve the existing barriers and working with elected officials to get money for more fencing, said the authority's new executive director, Elliot G. Sander.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 2, 2007, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the formation of a task force to improve safety along unfenced tracks of the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road, where a Queens boy was struck and killed this month, gave an erroneous spelling in some copies for the surname of a New York City councilman who appeared at a news conference on the task force. He is Eric N. Gioia, not Jioa.</p>
