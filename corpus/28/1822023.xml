        <p>Editorial sees need for New Jersey, which has strong home rule tradition, to consolidate hundreds of local government units in order to cut high property taxes</p>

        <p>Just about everyone in the New Jersey Legislature knows that a major reason for high property taxes in the state is the existence of so many municipalities (566), school districts (616) and hundreds of other governmental units in a state relatively small in area.</p>
        <p>But few members of that Legislature want to do very much to abolish any of them.</p>
        <p>Yes, we are aware that the state Senate last week approved a bill creating a commission to recommend the merger, or at least the consolidation of services, of some of these governments. But the measure passed only after its teeth were removed. Earlier proposals would have given the commission some power to compel mergers, to offer towns financial incentives for merging and to impose penalties for refusing to do so. But these were dropped in favor of a provision requiring any proposed merger to be approved by the affected towns' voters. Residents are likely to be unenthusiastic about abolishing their own towns.</p>
        <p>More than most states, New Jersey has a strong home rule tradition in which legislators and other political officials are reluctant to intrude on the authority of local governments to run their affairs. Considering the state's soaring property taxes, New Jersey residents are paying too high a price to preserve this outmoded tradition.</p>
