        <p>For years, golf was scarce in the Caribbean, where strict development rules and lack of fresh water posed major challenges. But thanks in part to a new breed of salt-tolerant turf grass, known as paspalum, golf courses have been springing up on many islands in recent years. Anguilla got its first golf course in November. Barbados, which has a total of seven courses, played host to the World Golf Championships for the first time last month. And the Dominican Republic, with a new Jack Nicklaus-designed course, Punta Espada, and half a dozen other courses planned, is quickly gaining notice among golfers as a hotspot to tee-off.</p>
        <p>But for many avid golfers, the island of choice remains Jamaica. While it may be better known for reggae, Jamaica also has 12 golf courses, with a range in difficulty to suit every level of player. Most courses are in and around resort centers, making it easy to play a round at one course in the morning and hit a different set of links in the afternoon. Montego Bay, a resort city on the north coast of the island, has three notable courses -- Half Moon Golf Club, a Robert Trent Jones Sr.-designed course; White Witch, owned by Ritz-Carlton; and Cinnamon Hill, at the Rose Hall Resort &amp; Country Club -- all within a 10-minute drive of one another.</p>

        <p>But for many avid golfers, the island of choice remains Jamaica. While it may be better known for reggae, Jamaica also has 12 golf courses, with a range in difficulty to suit every level of player. Most courses are in and around resort centers, making it easy to play a round at one course in the morning and hit a different set of links in the afternoon. Montego Bay, a resort city on the north coast of the island, has three notable courses -- Half Moon Golf Club, a Robert Trent Jones Sr.-designed course; White Witch, owned by Ritz-Carlton; and Cinnamon Hill, at the Rose Hall Resort &amp; Country Club -- all within a 10-minute drive of one another.</p>
        <p>Green fees in Jamaica range from $23 for the nine-hole Manchester Golf Club in Mandeville, the oldest golf course in the Caribbean, to $200 at the White Witch. Caddies are mandatory at most courses and will cost $14 to $45 more.</p>
        <p>WHERE TO STAY -- Later this year, the Half Moon Resort, in the Rose Hall area of Montego Bay, is scheduled to open a $4 million spa. Rooms start at $355 a night; (866-648-6951, www.halfmoon.com). At the Ritz-Carlton Golf &amp; Spa Resort, Montego Bay, ocean-view rooms begin at $459 a night through March; (800-241-3333, www.ritzcarlton.com). Rose Hall Resort &amp; Country Club has rooms from $149 a night; (866-831-1313, wwwrosehallresort.com).</p>
