        <p>Traditionalists and new-flamenco fans come to near-blows this time each year. That is the fault of the World Music Institute and the mix of pure and hybrid in its NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL, which opens on Saturday with a performance at Town Hall by ESTRELLA MORENTE, the Andalusian vocalist whose singing is heard on the soundtrack of Pedro Almodóvar's ''Volver.'' The stars this year include JOAQUÍN GRILO, ''king of buleria,'' and ISABEL BAYÓN (Feb. 15 at City Center), RAFAELA CARRASCO (Feb. 16 at City Center), SARA BARAS (Feb. 17 to 18 at City Center) and CARMEN CORTÉS, known for her Gypsy flamenco puro style (Feb. 22 at the Skirball Center). The festival ends on Feb. 24 with the richly provocative-sounding MÁLAGA EN FLAMENCO, a group of dancers and musicians native to a seaport city in southern Spain that is not so well known here for its flamenco tradition. Saturday through Feb. 24, (212) 545-7536, www.worldmusicinstitute.org; prices vary.</p>
        <p>The Kitchen describes D D DORVILLIER'S ''NOTTTHING IS IMPORTANTTT'' as a new cinema performance. On the theater's Web site, Ms. Dorvillier writes about the piece, which opens on Friday, in the past tense in a note dated 2008. No matter. No one goes to see Ms. Dorvillier and her piquant performers for the sense of the work. The point is her wild imagination and the ways she makes her ideas three-dimensional in terms of daring theater and design. 8 p.m., also Saturday and Feb. 7-10, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, or thekitchen.org; $12.</p>
        <p>Now more than 20 years old, RONALD K. BROWN'S EVIDENCE DANCE COMPANY will present ''Truth Don Die'' in a program that opens Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. Set to music by Omotayo Wunmi Olaiya, Fred Hammond, Meshell Ndegeocello and Femi Kuti, the piece travels with a man named Truth, whose eventual death in his homeland, Nigeria, does not stop him from spreading the word of God. Through Feb. 4, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $38, $29 for Joyce members.</p>
