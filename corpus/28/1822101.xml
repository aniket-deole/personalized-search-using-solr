        <p>''I no longer have clients who demand that I be at certain places at certain times, so I'm much more in control of my time,'' said Mr. Meyer, who has joined Meyer &amp; Company, a privately held investment firm that is based in New York and run by his son, Anthony E. Meyer.</p>

        <p>At a benefit for the Manhattan Theater Club last week, Edward H. Meyer, the former chairman and chief executive of Grey Global, was waxing ecstatic about his month-old retirement from the ad game.</p>
        <p>''I no longer have clients who demand that I be at certain places at certain times, so I'm much more in control of my time,'' said Mr. Meyer, who has joined Meyer &amp; Company, a privately held investment firm that is based in New York and run by his son, Anthony E. Meyer.</p>
        <p>''To suddenly wake up one morning and say, 'I can plot this day pretty much as I wish to do it, and if I want to take an hour off, just walk around the city, I can,' that's what's exhilarating,'' the elder Mr. Meyer added.</p>
        <p>Also at the benefit was David C. Hodgson, managing director of General Atlantic, the private equity fund. He said his personal theatrical experience was limited to performing in ''Rumpelstiltskin'' in fourth grade, near Rochester.</p>
        <p>''I was good, I gotta tell you,'' he reminisced.</p>
