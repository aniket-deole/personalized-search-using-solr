        <p>SHERWOOD--Louis M., M.D., the first chairman of the Unified Department of Medicine of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, died on January 25, 2007 at age 69. Lou graduated from Johns Hopkins University and from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1961. He had a distinguished career as an endocrinology researcher, clinician, teacher, and administrator at Harvard, the University of Chicago, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. In 1987, he left Einstein to join Merck &amp; Co., where he became the Senior Vice President of Medical and Scientific Affairs in their U.S. Human Health Division until his retirement in 2005. Lou was a dynamic and vigorous leader in his various roles. The Department notes his passing with sorrow. Victor L. Schuster, M.D. Baumritter Professor and Chairman Department of Medicine; Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University; Montefiore Medical Center</p>
