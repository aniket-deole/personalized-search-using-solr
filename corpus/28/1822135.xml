        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Public Parks and Private Schools'' (editorial, Jan. 21), you indicated correctly that for local public school students, and adults, without private transportation, Randalls Island is reachable only by a pedestrian and bike bridge. What you didn't say is that the East 103rd Street crossing is for some reason closed for five months of the year.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Public Parks and Private Schools'' (editorial, Jan. 21), you indicated correctly that for local public school students, and adults, without private transportation, Randalls Island is reachable only by a pedestrian and bike bridge. What you didn't say is that the East 103rd Street crossing is for some reason closed for five months of the year.</p>
        <p>The mayor and the Randall's Island Sports Foundation could build confidence in their intentions by opening it up year-round.</p>
        <p>You also said that the plan to build a 26-acre ''water park'' on Randalls Island drew an objection from Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer ''over a projected $40 ticket price.'' The combined indoor-outdoor adult admission to the park would be over $60, and Mr. Stringer voted to support it anyway.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was thrilled to read ''Public Parks and Private Schools,'' which finally puts into perspective the vast community need for more athletic fields on Randalls Island -- a critical message that has barely been touched upon in previous coverage of this project.</p>
        <p>As founder and director of CYO/Manhattan Youth Baseball, I've coordinated with the Randall's Island Sports Foundation for many years to schedule games and practices, and can attest to their challenge in meeting the overwhelming demand from public and independent schools, community organizations and their own Randall's Island Kids youth programming.</p>
        <p>In spearheading this project and finding a way to realize it even without sufficient city financing, the Randall's Island Sports Foundation paints a perfect picture of the role a public-private partner should play in our city's parks.</p>
