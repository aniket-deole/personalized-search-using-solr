        <p>Marie-Galante, one of the larger islands of the Guadeloupe archipelago, is a throwback to a bygone era. Nineteenth-century windmills dot the island and ox-drawn carts, once the chief means of transportation on the island, are not an uncommon sight even today. On Sundays, there are draught ox competitions and cock fights according to Luigy Ssosse, a representative of the Guadeloupe Committee of Tourism.</p>
        <p>''It's a place which looks like Guadeloupe did 30 year ago,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Christopher Columbus gave the island its name, calling it after his flagship Maria Galanda, when he landed there during his second New World voyage in 1493. It is also known as ''la grande galette'' or big pancake due to its round shape and relatively flat surface. (It helps to know some French, although English is spoken in most hotels.)</p>
        <p>Today, sugar production remains the principal industry and three distilleries produce high-quality rum. But tourism is gaining ground as more visitors learn of its deserted white-sand beaches and Old World charm. Marie-Galante can be reached within 45 minutes by boat or 15 minutes by plane from Pointe-à-Pitre in Guadeloupe.</p>
        <p>WHERE TO STAY -- Le Village de Ménard, St.-Louis, Marie-Galante. Prices for its 11 small cottages start at 70 euros (about $90 at one euro to $1.29) a night through April. (590-590-97-09-45, www.villagedemenard.com). Cap Reva at La Feuillère beach has studio apartments for 90 euros) in season. (590-590-97-50-00, www.cap-reva.com).</p>
