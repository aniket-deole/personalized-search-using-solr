        <p>Upper East Side Duplex  $899,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 160 East 91st Street (between Lexington and Third Avenues), #1A</p>

        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,177 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: Recently renovated, this apartment has a big open kitchen, two bathrooms with limestone tile and two walk-in closets. The second bedroom is being used as a family room and opens onto a charming garden covered in brick and ivy.</p>
        <p>CONS: The master bedroom gets very little light because it is below ground level.</p>

        <p>TAXES: $27,205</p>
