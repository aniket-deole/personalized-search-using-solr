        <p>Playing bingo might seem a more likely pastime for a grandmother than running drugs, but a jury found that Leticia Villareal-Garcia did one so she could afford to do the other.</p>
        <p>On Friday a judge sentenced Ms. Villareal-Garcia, 62, to three years in prison and fined her $150,000 after she was convicted of carrying more than 200 pounds of marijuana from her home in Douglas to a casino in Tucson.</p>
        <p>When the police, acting on an informant's tip, stopped Ms. Villareal-Garcia's car on Feb. 12, 2005, they smelled a strong odor of fresh-cut marijuana, officials said, and found 214 pounds of it hidden in the trunk.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Villareal-Garcia insisted that she had no idea the drug was there.</p>
        <p>At her trial in November in Cochise County Superior Court, she testified that her son's long-lost godfather had shown up unannounced the day before her arrest and briefly borrowed her car. Her lawyer, Robert Zohlmann, told jurors that Ms. Villareal-Garcia had been a ''blind mule,'' tricked unwittingly, perhaps by the godfather, into ferrying the drugs.</p>
        <p>At the start of the trial, the prosecutor, Doyle Johnstun, seemed to be building his case on circumstantial evidence, like the fact that Ms. Villareal-Garcia was driving with her windows down in chilly winter weather, presumably to lessen the smell of marijuana.</p>
        <p>But when a string of character witnesses, on cross-examination, testified that Ms. Villareal-Garcia played bingo nearly every night in Douglas or Tucson, and when the defendant herself said her only regular income was her sporadic bingo winnings and a $275 monthly welfare check she received for caring for her granddaughter, Mr. Johnstun thought he had a motive.</p>
        <p>People who play bingo almost every night of the week end up losing in the long run, Mr. Johnstun told the eight jurors. ''The underlying issue is that she's got a bingo problem,'' he said, ''which explains why an otherwise nice person might get sucked into something like this.''</p>
        <p>The jury deliberated less than two hours before finding the defendant guilty of transporting marijuana for sale.</p>
        <p>Ms. Villareal-Garcia maintained her innocence at the sentencing.</p>
        <p>''I never, never had any knowledge of that car being loaded when I went to Tucson,'' she told Judge Wallace R. Hoggatt during a brief but emotional statement.</p>
        <p>Although he could have sentenced her to as much as 12 1/2 years in prison, the judge, citing Ms. Villareal-Garcia's age and lack of prior convictions, opted for a minimum term of three years and the fine.</p>
