        <p>LAD--John F. An active NYC violist, taijiquan practitioner and teacher, and lecturer in philosophy at Barnard College for 25 years, John died suddenly on 23 January, 2007, while at bagua practice. John had practiced taijiquan since 1975 in the tradition of Professor Cheng Man-ching, and taught taijiquan for both Barnard and Columbia. He had a passion for new music by emerging composers; he was longtime violist of the American Composers' Orchestra, the Michael Gordon Philharmonic, and was involved in the origins of the ''Bang-on-aCan'' Festival. Respected and loved by many whom he befriended and with whom he performed, he will be missed. John was deeply in touch with nature, especially the mountains of the western US. Born 24 September, 1945, he is survived by his loving partner Cathy Chou; loving parents Dr. Robert A. lad and Dr. Dolores T. Lad of Cleveland, Ohio; loving brothers and sisters Tom, Frank, Kathryn, Mary, Margaret, Matthew, Robert, and Cecilia; fourteen dear nieces and nephews; and many loving friends. John donated his skin and bones for use by the public. He shared his talents and diverse knowledge with all who knew him. Memorial events in New York and Cleveland will be notified on the website www.users.cloud9.net/ cwchou/John/index.htm (BUT type a tilde before ''cwchou''. )</p>
