        <p>As a board member and resident of the building directly across the street from Heathers bar (''The Sound and the Fury,'' Jan. 21), I believe that the public opposition to the noise problem is legitimate and more than just an ''active minority'' of residents.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a board member and resident of the building directly across the street from Heathers bar (''The Sound and the Fury,'' Jan. 21), I believe that the public opposition to the noise problem is legitimate and more than just an ''active minority'' of residents. My neighbors and I regularly endure noise and many other disturbances to our quality of life resulting from Heathers.</p>
        <p>Although I live in the back of the building, I must now leave some of my windows closed at night year-round to avoid hearing the noise.</p>
        <p>Many residents of our building are suffering from the nightly commotion, even with windows closed. One unit-owner recently moved out, citing the disturbances from Heathers, specifically, as the main reason for moving. For these reasons, I believe that the vast majority of the residents of our building and this block oppose the renewal of Heathers' liquor license.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am a designer and artist living on 13th Street, two doors down from Heathers. As a patron, I appreciate the gluten-free beer and potato vodka, but primarily it is the vibe that brings me back.</p>
        <p>Not since leaving the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco have I found a place that feels like a true community of locals, varied in interest, age, profession and gender. Heathers is one of the few gems at night that reflects what the East Village could be.</p>
        <p>Before Heathers, the space was an after-hours club, and as a neighbor I much prefer Heathers. As a patron I am glad it has withstood the complaints, and I hope that the two parties can resolve their issues.</p>
