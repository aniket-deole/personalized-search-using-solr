        <p>It appears that the right to smoke in Atlantic City's casinos will be preserved after the City Council gave preliminary approval last week to a compromise measure supported by casino owners.</p>
        <p>The new measure, introduced at the council's meeting on Wednesday and due for a full vote on Feb. 7, would allow smoking on 25 percent of each casino's floors.</p>
        <p>A state law that went into effect April 15 prohibited smoking in public places but exempted casinos. Casino executives said then that if smoking was banned, gamblers would go to casinos elsewhere and that the state would lose tourist spending and tax money from casino winnings.</p>
        <p>A loophole in the law, though, allowed Atlantic City itself to ban smoking at the casinos, and on Dec. 29 the City Council gave preliminary approval to an ordinance that would do just that.</p>
        <p>Joseph A. Corbo Jr., the executive director of the New Jersey Casino Association, said such a ban might cost as much as 20 percent of casino revenues and cause as many as 3,000 people to lose jobs. The measure was supposed to come up for a vote last Wednesday, but instead the council gave preliminary approval to the compromise measure, 7 to 2.</p>
        <p>Some casino employees at the meeting said their concern about having to breathe second-hand smoke would not be mitigated by the compromise. Regina Carlson, the executive director of New Jersey GASP, an antismoking group, said she was livid that the council was backing down from its original no-smoking ordinance.</p>
        <p>''The goal of this process was to protect the casino workers, but this does not; it leaves any employee on any given shift with a threat to their health,'' said Ms. Carlson, noting that the operators of the proposed slot-machine parlors in nearby Philadelphia have pledged a smoking ban.</p>
