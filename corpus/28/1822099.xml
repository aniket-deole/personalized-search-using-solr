        <p>In her first public appearance since her well-publicized firing as Wal-Mart's top advertising executive, Julie Roehm resurfaced at the Reuters Newsmakers panel discussion on Super Bowl advertising in Times Square on Wednesday, and she quickly demonstrated that she had lost none of her ability to deliver pithy, quotable remarks.</p>

        <p>Ms. Roehm made no mention that she had filed a lawsuit last month against Wal-Mart, accusing it of breach of contract and fraud in connection with her dismissal. Wal-Mart, in court papers filed in response on Jan. 18, denied her accusations.</p>
