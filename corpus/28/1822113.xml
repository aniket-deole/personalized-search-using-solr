        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''What's a Pound of Prevention Really Worth?'' (Economix column, Jan. 24), David Leonhardt says ''the economic gains from preventive care are sometimes exaggerated.'' Perhaps so, but the reason he cites -- that the cheapest patients are the ones who die quickly without much medical care -- is economically myopic.</p>
        <p>It is myopic because it neglects economic gains outside the health care system. In fact, society suffers a great economic loss when one of its productive members dies prematurely. These economic losses are recognized by our legal system in cases of wrongful death where damages are tied to lost future earnings.</p>
        <p>Consider an example on a more tragic scale: the AIDS epidemic in Africa has not been economically devastating because of the high cost of treatment. Rather, most of the economic consequences stem from the loss of millions of productive members of society.</p>
