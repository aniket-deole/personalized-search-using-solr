        <p>GOLDBERG--Lisa. We have lost a dear colleague. Lisa's commitment to a robust democracy, progressive values, and her belief in the ability to change the world through engaging in civil society was unparalleled. She was a mentor and an innovator in her work and inspired others to reach for excellence. We have lost a precious friend. Lisa brought joy, compassion, wisdom, and loyalty to those of us lucky enough to be her friends. Our lives are richer for having been touched by hers. Our hearts are with John, Katie, Jed, Danielle, and all her family and friends as they cope with this heartbreaking loss. Drummond Pike Ellen Friedman Tides Foundation and Tides Center</p>
        <p>$(6$)GOLDBERG--Lisa. On behalf of the entire faculty of New York University, we extend deepest condolences to the family of Lisa Goldberg, cherished wife of our University President, John Sexton. We join her colleagues and many friends in being profoundly saddened by this sudden, and untimely loss. The Faculty Senators Council of New York University</p>
        <p>$(6$)GOLDBERG--Lisa. Friend, teacher, inspiration, and supporter, who spoke with passion of her family, books, ideas and social policy. You left us much too soon. Arthur Levine, Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation.</p>
        <p>$(6$)GOLDBERG--Lisa The Board of Directors, faculty and staff of the New York University Child Study Center mourn the loss of Lisa Goldberg, wife of NYU President John Sexton, mother of Jed and Katie, mother-in-law of Danielle, grandmother of Julia, Ava and Natalie and friend to many of us.
