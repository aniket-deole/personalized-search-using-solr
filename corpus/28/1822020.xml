        <p>Two years ago New Jersey Transit introduced fare increases that averaged nearly 10 percent. Now it wants similar fare increases on its buses and trains beginning this year.</p>
        <p>George D. Warrington, the executive director of the agency, who announced his retirement earlier this year, said the latest fare increases were necessary to help close a budget gap and maintain infrastructure.</p>
        <p>New Jersey Transit, which announced last Tuesday that 10 percent increases were likely, said it has a $1.5 billion budget with a $60 million deficit. Nearly 860,000 people use the statewide system daily, and the agency said it planned to continue to increase capacity on all of its bus, train and light-rail lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warrington said he would offer specific fare proposals at a meeting of the agency's board next month, and there would be public hearings in February and March. If approved, the new fares are expected to take effect in June.</p>
        <p>''While record-setting ridership brings in more fare revenue, it does not keep pace with the cost for new services that are added to meet demand,'' said H. Charles Wedel, the agency's chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>The agency also approved the purchase of 1,145 buses to replace its aging fleet over the next six years at a cost of $409.9 million. The buses will begin to arrive later this year and be equipped with multiple closed-circuit cameras that can digitally record passengers and drivers, the agency said. The cameras are activated by the driver or in the event of an accident. Officials said the cameras would improve security on the buses.</p>
