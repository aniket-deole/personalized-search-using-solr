        <p>Money Matters</p>
        <p>Never known as models of financial restraint, the Knicks topped the N.B.A. last season with a payroll of more than $120 million, and paid Larry Brown $10 million to coach the team and another $18.5 million to go away.</p>
        <p>Those and other questionable decisions led to nearly $40 million in operating losses for the season.</p>
        <p>Despite those facts, the team was named the most valuable franchise in the N.B.A. by Forbes magazine, with a total value of $592 million.</p>
        <p>Losing His Grip</p>
        <p>Having missed 35 games to injury, Heat center SHAQUILLE O'NEAL has a lot of work ahead to get back into game shape.</p>
        <p>His 6.5 rebounds a game (through six games) placed him behind the team leader, UDONIS HASLEM, above, who was averaging 8.8 rebounds a game.</p>
        <p>In his 15-year professional career, O'Neal has always finished as his team's leader in rebounds.</p>
        <p>After losses to the Pacers and the Knicks last week despite O'Neal's return, Miami faces Milwaukee twice this week and has a marquee matchup against LeBRON JAMES and the Cavaliers.</p>
        <p>O'Neal will try to help the Heat recover from what has been a disappointing follow-up to a championship season.</p>
        <p>Nothing but Net</p>
        <p>While the Web site for the basketball Hall of Fame, HoopHall.com, is not flashy, it offers a year-by-year list of inductees, including the inaugural class, which featured the creator of the game, James Naismith, above.</p>
        <p>Featuring photographs and detailed biographies of each inductee, the site is a must for any fan trying to find out more about the history of the game.</p>
