        <p>The authorities are investigating the partial sinking yesterday of a paddleboat in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, that once was used for party cruises.</p>
        <p>The 89-foot boat, called the Sunset Queen, began to sink after a night watchman heard a bang from somewhere on the vessel about 5:30 a.m., law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>The boat, moored to a pier in the bay, had been decommissioned since October, when its certificate of inspection expired, according to Petty Officer Third Class Daniel Bender, a spokesman for the Coast Guard.</p>
        <p>After the bang, the watchman said, the boat began listing and sinking. The Coast Guard said it was notified about 9:30 a.m., and arrived soon after to discover the vessel's stern submerged. About 1 p.m., the incoming tide flooded the vents to the fuel tanks, Officer Bender said.</p>
        <p>Some fuel began to spill into the bay; the boat's owner, Anthony Zito, said the tanks held about 1,200 gallons of diesel fuel, according to law enforcement officials.</p>
        <p>After the watchman heard the bang, he said he discovered broken glass and a smashed window in the boat's pantry, the police said. They said it was unclear whether the broken window was related to the bang or partial sinking.</p>
        <p>The watchman, whose name was not released, said he had been hired because of previous break-ins, the police said.</p>
