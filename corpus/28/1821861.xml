        <p>GORMAN--Rhoda (Edelman) 72 of Scottsdale, AZ, passed away January 17, 2007. Rhoda, a native New Yorker, graduated from Queens College and Far Rockaway High School. She encouraged her family to love and respect one another, to accept each person for whom they are, to read, enjoy literature and art, and to eat healthy and exercise. Only a disease such as ALS could get the best of her. Her sense of humor and subtle wit, as well as her dignity and grace were legendary. Rhoda was truly loved by all whose lives she touched. Rhoda, is survived by her husband Irwin; children David Gorman, Cindy Llobell and Lisa Miller; grandchildren Keith Evans, Vincent Llobell, Matthew Evans, Linda Llobell, and Pamela Evans; and sisters Marcia Altman and Gail Weinrib. Rhoda and Irwin met in their first year at College and were married over 50 years. Their 50th year pledge was 100 years wont be enough and they're still working on that. Donations may be made to Hospice of the Valley, Sherman Home at 5801 E. Mayo Blvd., Phoenix, AZ 85054</p>
