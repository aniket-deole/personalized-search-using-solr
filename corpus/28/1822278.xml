        <p>There was a time when teenagers could spend the summer doing nothing more challenging than working at a camp or filing papers at Dad's office and still get into Harvard. No more. Now they had better be polishing their résumés. Luckily, they can do it in places that give them a taste of adventure and offer a break from home.</p>
        <p>The New York-based China Institute is offering high school students the chance to take intensive language classes this summer (July 10 to Aug. 13) while living with a host family in Beijing. Weekday four-hour Mandarin classes are complemented by after-class workshops (mask painting, calligraphy, martial arts), trips to heritage sites (the Forbidden City, the Great Wall and the Temple of Heaven) and community service projects. The cost of the trip is $6,000, including air fare; scholarships are available. The deadline for applications is March 2; www.chinasummerstudy.org.</p>
