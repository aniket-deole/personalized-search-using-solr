        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A School Search Shaded by Painful Memories,'' by Benilde Little (Generations, Jan. 7):</p>
        <p>As head of school for St. Philip's Academy, and father (I am black, my wife is white) of three young children adopted from Guatemala, I know all too well the difficulties of choosing the right school for a child. I am sad that Ms. Little did not have the opportunity to look at our school as an alternative.</p>
        <p>St. Philip's is a K-8 private inner-city school that accepts students based on academic motivation and regardless of their family's ability to pay tuition. Thus, we embrace a more holistic kind of diversity, not only racial, but socioeconomic as well.</p>
        <p>Our students come from a wide array of family circumstances and adversity, some from shelters each morning, some from comfortable homes. Yet, what allows our students to reach their full potential is our belief that all children are equal and, given the proper individual nurturing and support, will succeed.</p>
        <p>I call on all schools and communities to create environments that build self-esteem, enthusiasm and integrity as the platform for high achievement for all.</p>
        <p>Miguel J. Brito  Newark</p>
