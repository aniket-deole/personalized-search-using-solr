        <p>ALTHOUGH some 1,900 cars were sold at the recent Phoenix-area auctions, not all were muscle cars, famous racers or 1930s classics. Here are some other noteworthy sales this year.</p>
        <p>1903 FORD MODEL A REAR ENTRANCE TONNEAU The Model A was Ford's first product, and this is the only remaining car sold on July 13, 1903, the first day that orders were recorded. Extensive documentation proved this to be the oldest Ford still in existence. While $880 was enough to buy one in 1903, its sale price at RM was $693,000.</p>
        <p>1957 FERRARI 250 GT BOANO Ferrari called the Boano berlinetta ''a production car which benefited from experience in racing.'' Its subdued styling once kept values among the lowest of the V-12 Ferraris, but prices moved up by the end of the 1980s. Now $400,000 is usually enough to secure a nice one, but this Boano sold for $726,000 at RM.</p>
        <p>1959 FIAT JOLLY The star of this year's ''What were they thinking?'' conversations in Scottsdale, this curious anachronism by Ghia, with wicker seats and a Surrey top, is just the thing to ride on the fantail of a Mediterranean yacht. Jollys are relatively sensible purchases at $30,000 and completely over the top at $40,000. This bright yellow one sold for $81,400 at Barrett-Jackson.</p>
        <p>GENERAL MOTORS TRANSIT BUS Now accepted as an American antihero, the artist Kenneth Howard (a k a Von Dutch) was renowned for his pinstriping skills during the day and his bad-tempered binges at night. Posthumously famous because of the clothing and other items bearing his name, Von Dutch lived in this 1960s bus in his final years, and also used it as a machine shop. It sold for $46,000 at Barrett-Jackson.</p>
        <p>1965 SHELBY GT350 FASTBACK Carroll Shelby's modified Mustangs always bring a premium. Generally, the earlier the car was built, the better. This Shelby's serial number ends with 166, so it's not even part of the exclusive two-digit club. Still, with bidding bouncing back and forth in thousand-dollar increments at Russo &amp; Steele, the car finally went for $358,600, a record for this model.</p>
        <p>1967 TOYOTA CORONA With the original tires and 8,500 miles on the odometer, this cute, unpretentious time capsule captivated the crowds. Silver sold it for $16,740.</p>
        <p>1967 CHEVROLET CORVETTE COUPE Promoted as ''the last Sting Ray,'' this car was featured in a six-part Speed channel program during its restoration. While many collectors expected the price to exceed $1 million, the car brought $660,000 at Barrett-Jackson.</p>
        <p>1971 PLYMOUTH HEMI 'CUDA CONVERTIBLE This car spent most of its early life on the drag strip as the ''Mountain Mopar'' drag car, but was retired in 1974 with only 286 miles on the odometer. Completely documented and restored, it brought $2.4 million at RM, on par with prices of similarly rare 'Cudas over the past year.</p>
        <p>1993 HUMMER H1 This modified Hummer (''CNN Warrior One'') was used by TV crews in Iraq and rebuilt on the TV series ''Overhaulin' '' with a 450-horse engine, unique wheels and a stereo as loud as an F-16 at takeoff. Four airbrush artists decorated the outside with heroic images. The $1.25 million it raised at Barrett-Jackson goes to the Fisher House foundation for military families in need.</p>
