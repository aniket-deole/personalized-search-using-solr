        <p>Although it has been a decade since the Museum of Modern Art's giant Jasper Johns retrospective, there have been a spate of smaller shows devoted to aspects of his work. Now the National Gallery of Art in Washington has put its own spin on his oeuvre with ''JASPER JOHNS: AN ALLEGORY OF PAINTING, 1955-1965,'' which opens today.</p>
        <p>Not wanting it to seem like either another retrospective or a survey show, Jeffrey Weiss, the gallery's curator of modern and contemporary art, has traced this artist's work through four motifs: the target, the mechanical device, the stenciled naming of colors and the imprint of the body.</p>
        <p>Included in the show will be 84 works from public and private collections, including the largest group of target paintings ever assembled. Among them is ''Target With Plaster Casts'' (1955), which is the image on the cover of the show's catalog. It has been lent by David Geffen, the entertainment mogul. Also on view will be many of Mr. Johns's most famous works, like ''False Start'' (1959), which now belongs to the Chicago collector Kenneth C. Griffin, and ''Jubilee'' (1960). Through April 29; nga.gov.</p>
        <p>An exhibition devoted to another popular American artist, ROBERT GOBER, opens Saturday at two of the Matthew Marks Galleries in Chelsea. Like Mr. Johns, Mr. Gober is known for using familiar vernacular American forms in his work.</p>
        <p>Consisting of only new works -- two sculptures and several drawings -- the exhibition will feature a sculpture of a plastic milk crate filled with sculptures of Granny Smith apples that rests on a cast of a wooden footstool in the space at 526 West 22nd Street. A block away, at 521 West 21st Street, will be a second cast of a wooden footstool, this one made with an old packing blanket folded on the seat. Through March 10; (212) 243-0200.</p>
