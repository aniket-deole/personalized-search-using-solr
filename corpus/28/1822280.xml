        <p>With new rules now in effect requiring that all United States residents carry a passport when they return from the Caribbean, Mexico or Canada, tourism officials in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands (including St. John, left) are busily reminding American travelers that they can still visit those islands without a passport.</p>
        <p>''It is not that we don't want people to apply for a passport,'' said Nelly Cruz Rodriguez, public relations director for the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, which promotes tourism for the Puerto Rican government. ''But you don't have to wait for your passport to arrive to come here,'' she said, adding that the new online booking engine www.gotopuertorico.com is aimed at the roughly 75 percent of United States citizens who don't have passports.</p>

        <p>Officials are also starting a travel promotion called ''Puerto Rico Now!'' in conjunction with Liberty Travel. Those who book a trip to Puerto Rico between Feb. 8 and 19 for travel through Sept. 15 receive a $300 air-fare credit for each room at more than 30 participating hotels in Puerto Rico (www.libertytravel.com). At some hotels, customers will receive a fourth night free.</p>
        <p>The rules have been a boon. ''We are getting 30 calls a day from people wondering if they need a passport to come here,'' said Steve Bornn, director of marketing for the Virgin Islands Department of Tourism.</p>
        <p>Anticipating a boom in passport-free business, Northwest Airlines recently started nonstop Saturday service from Detroit to St. Thomas, and Delta is introducing nonstop service from Kennedy Airport to St. Thomas on March 3.</p>
