        <p>Goyard, the French maker of must-have handbags and totes, may have out-luxed itself. Historically, customers have personalized the company's carryalls with hand-painted monograms and stripes in a palette of bright racing-stable colors. Now, Goyard has raised the glamour ante, offering personalization in eye-catching gold and silver; the Goyard Boutique at Bergdorf Goodman (212-872-2517) will start taking orders for the new shades around Feb. 10. ''The new metallic colors are certain to create a frenzy on Fifth Avenue,'' said Edwin Burstell, a senior vice president of the store. The St. Jeanne bag in medium is $1,490 to $1,940. As for its gilded and silvered adornments -- which take about a month to complete -- three initials will set you back $190, stripes at least $310.</p>
