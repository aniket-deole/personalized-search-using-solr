        <p>The couple met in February 2004 on a Southwest Airlines flight from Sacramento to Los Angeles that offered open seating. ''I remember seeing him walk down the aisle and thinking he was very handsome,'' Ms. Walter said. ''I thought, 'Why doesn't someone like that ever sit next to me?' ''</p>
        <p>When he took the seat right beside her, she remembered being ''very excited'' and then disappointed when he failed to utter a word.</p>
        <p>''Halfway through the flight, after drinks were served, he started talking,'' Ms. Walter said. He had been holding back, Mr. Hadidi later revealed, as he attempted to gauge her interest. Before going their separate ways they exchanged telephone numbers.</p>
        <p>''He called that week,'' Ms. Walter said, and they became a couple almost immediately.</p>
