        <p>Several government reports suggested that the economy remains robust -- perhaps too much so to justify a cut in the Fed funds rate, the Fed's benchmark short-term rate, which has remained at 5.25 percent since June.

        <p>Shares of General Motors gained 4.4 percent for the week, the most among the Dow industrials. The company said it would report a profit for the fourth quarter, although its 2006 financial results would be delayed.</p>
        <p>For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 78.51 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 12,487.02. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 8.32 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,422.18. The Nasdaq composite index lost 15.82 points, or about 0.7 percent, to close at 2,435.49.</p>
        <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond climbed to 4.87 percent from 4.78 percent the previous week.</p>
