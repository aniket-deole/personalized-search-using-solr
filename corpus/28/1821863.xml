        <p>GRUNSCHLAG--Toni. The House of Steinway &amp; Sons notes with profound sorrow the passing of the eminent pianist Toni Grunschlag on January 12, in New York City. Natives of Vienna, Toni and her sister Rosi, who survives her, have been valued members of our Steinway Artist family for more than 50 years. A pupil of Emil von Sauer and a recipient of the Fritz Kreisler prize at the State Academy of Music and Art, Toni came to the United States with her sister in 1939. It was in 1940 that the distinguished New York Times critic Olin Downes heard Toni and Rosi play at Steinway Hall, after which he urged them to pursue a career as duo-pianists. From Bach to Casadesus to Consoli to Debussy, to Lutoslawski, Martinu, Mozart, and Starer, among so many others, Toni and Rosi have demonstrated their gift of making familiar music sound fresh, and new music enticing. They performed most recently in Vienna in May of 2006 before an outdoor audience of more than 25,000 on Holocaust Remembrance Day. To Rosi and to her cousin Rose Levy we extend our heartfelt condolences. Toni will be deeply missed. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Acivities</p>
