        <p>To the Editor: ''Budget Hotels in Europe: A Little Style, a Little Room and a Little Price'' by Michelle Higgins prompted me to inform your readers about Apsis Hotels, a small Spanish chain. There are seven hotels in Barcelona, one in Madrid, two in Girona, two in Andorra and one in Luchon, France.</p>
        <p>My wife and I recently stayed at the Gran Ducat, a centrally located hotel off the Plaza Catalunya and La Rambla. Our four-night stay was about $450. The rooms were very small, but had private facilities. We were upgraded to a Comfort Room which was in the rear of the hotel and less noisy.</p>

        <p>The hotel was a real bargain at a little over $100 a night. Barcelona can be expensive as the dollar continues to fall against the euro.</p>
