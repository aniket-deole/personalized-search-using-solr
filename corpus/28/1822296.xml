        <p>DONALD HARRISON's quartet, together at the same gig with MULGREW MILLER's trio: this is a double bill of serious and rewarding mainstream jazz -- maybe not this year's flavor, but jazz is forgivingly slow moving. Mr. Harrison, an alto saxophonist born in New Orleans in 1960, has never been anything less than interesting in his various bandleading iterations since the mid-'80s, and he has occasionally been stunning, for instance when playing the music of the Mardi Gras Indians or sharing a front line with the trumpeter Terence Blanchard. He's got sophisticated new harmony under his thumb, and he's a near-genius of rhythm. Mr. Miller, five years older, keeps turning jazz back toward whatever passes for its vernacular sources these days: blues and soul and the modern riverheads of tradition, McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock. 8 and 10:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday (both bands play each set), Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; at cover charge at tables, $25.</p>
        <p>What excellent group is the drummer PAUL MOTIAN playing with this week? Since he decided to stop traveling, New York's jazz scene has absorbed all his regular work, including at least four bands that he leads or co-leads. This week he's with his Trio 2000 +1, including the saxophonist Bill McHenry, the pianist Masabumi Kikuchi, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the singer Rebecca Martin. (I know, the math doesn't quite work.) It's a band almost overstuffed with musical personality, as if Mr. Motian's ninja minimalism weren't enough. Mr. Grenadier, an excellent bassist, will have to play the straight man. Mr. McHenry is an old-fashioned lyrical player, free around the edges. Mr. Kikuchi is an oblique cipher prone to flashes of sentiment. And the sweet-voiced Ms. Martin takes her time on ballads, savoring each syllable.  Tuesday through Sunday at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover charge, $30.</p>
