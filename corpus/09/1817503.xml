        <p>Some people take echinacea supplements in the hope that they will prevent or shorten colds, but a small study suggests that it may increase the number of intestinal bacteria associated with diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease and an increased risk of colon cancer.</p>
        <p>Researchers gave 15 volunteers 1,000 milligrams of Echinacea purpurea daily for 10 days. They collected stool samples before the supplementation, and at 10 days and 17 to 18 days after the volunteers had stopped taking the herb, then analyzed the samples for six types of bacteria. The study was published in December in The Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics.</p>
        <p>After controlling for other diet variables, the scientists found significant increases in microbial counts for Bacteroides, Bacteroides fragilis, and total aerobic bacteria. There was no effect on enteric bacteria, enterococci, Lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, or total anaerobic bacteria.</p>
        <p>''This changes the balance of the normal bacterial fauna,'' said Jerald C. Foote, an assistant professor of human nutrition at the University of Arkansas. ''But we don't know yet what this means.''</p>
        <p>Though the sample was small and the study was preliminary, the authors said it was the first to consider the effects of a botanical dietary supplement on gastrointestinal flora. Dr. Foote was not urging anyone to abandon echinacea. ''I think we need a lot more research before we start taking echinacea off the shelves,'' he said. ''But this does raise some questions.''</p>
