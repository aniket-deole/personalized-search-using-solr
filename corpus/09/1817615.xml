        <p>A friend and the widow of the former K.G.B. officer Alexander V. Litvinenko are collaborating on a book to be published by Free Press in May, ''Death of a Dissident: Alexander Litvinenko and the Death of Russian Democracy.'' Alex Goldfarb with Marina Litvinenko, right, will tell the story of Mr. Litvinenko and his career as a spy in the style of a political thriller. Mr. Litvinenko died of a high dose of the radioactive isotope polonium 210 in London in November, and before his death he accused the Russian government of poisoning him. Free Press is an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster.  The Sobol Award for Fiction, an online contest recruiting unpublished fiction writers, has been canceled, according to a statement on the contest's Web site (sobolaward.com). The statement said that an insufficient number of manuscripts were submitted. The promised prize for the winner of the contest, first announced in September, was representation with Sobol Literary Enterprises and a book deal with Touchstone, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. All entrants will be refunded the mandatory $85 entry fee, the statement said. The creators of the contest have endured criticism that the contest unfairly exploited unknown writers for money.  The Central Intelligence Agency has blocked Valerie Wilson from writing about her experience as an undercover officer for the agency in a new book, Newsweek reported. But the flagship imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster is still planning to publish her book sometime this year. Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon &amp; Schuster, declined comment.</p>
