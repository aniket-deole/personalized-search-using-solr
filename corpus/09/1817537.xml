        <p>The winds of change have blown through the 110th Congress, but only to a point. There are more women (90) and, obviously, more Democrats. But according to the Congressional Research Service, the average age of lawmakers in the new Congress is possibly the oldest in history. The average age of senators is 61.7 -- two years older than in the previous Congress. The oldest senator is Robert C. Byrd, 89, Democrat of West Virginia, and the youngest is John E. Sununu, 42, Republican of New Hampshire. The average age of representatives is 55.9, with Ralph M. Hall, Republican of Texas, the oldest at 83, and Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, the youngest at 31. More demographics: there are more Protestants than any other religious affiliation, but Roman Catholics account for the largest single religious denomination.</p>
