        <p>Introduced on Sunday: 2008 Nissan Rogue</p>
        <p>Is it real? Indisputably.</p>
        <p>What's the point? It seems as if every brand but Nissan has a small crossover utility wagon. Enter the Rogue, Nissan's first appearance at a crowded party where the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Hyundai Santa Fe are already guests.</p>
        <p>What they said: Taking a page from the VW Jetta playbook, Nissan will pitch the Rogue</p>
        <p>to younger singles and recently married couples who are sliding down that slippery slope down from their partying days to responsible adulthood.</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: While the Rogue looks like a strong contender in all other respects, it won't offer a V-6 engine, an option available in many competitors.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? It goes on sale in September as a 2008 model, starting around $20,000.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? The 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine produces 170 horsepower, which is directed to the wheels through a continuously variable transmission.</p>
        <p>How's it look? With a family resemblance to the larger Infiniti FX and Nissan Murano, the Rogue seems to have more of a cute-ute appeal than a rebel streak.</p>
