        <p>A Chicago alderman who is running for re-election was arrested on federal bribery charges, the authorities said. Prosecutors say an undercover investigation revealed that the alderman, Arenda Troutman, accepted a $5,000 cash bribe and agreed to accept $10,000 more, as well as a $5,000 political contribution, in exchange for using her office to support zoning changes on behalf of a private developer -- a developer that was, in fact, a fictitious entity set up as part of the investigation. Bond for Ms. Troutman was set at $10,000. She plans to plead not guilty, her lawyer told The Associated Press.</p>
