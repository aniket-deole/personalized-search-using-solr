        <p>As the nation awaits President Bush's speech on Wednesday night outlining his new approach to Iraq, a sampling of announced or likely 2008 presidential candidates are staking out positions on a spectrum from hawk to dove.</p>
        <p>JOHN M. BRODER</p>
        <p>REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona  2002 INVASION: Voted to authorize use of force.  TROOP INCREASE: Supports increase as long as it is large enough to assure success and sustained enough to finish the job.  WITHDRAWAL: Opposes deadlines for the American mission. Has called for continued support for Iraqi authorities until they reach a political settlement.</p>
        <p>Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachussetts  2002 INVASION: Supported the invasion.  TROOP INCREASE: Has not commented specifically.  WITHDRAWAL: Says the United States should not withdraw forces ''before Iraq is secure.''</p>
        <p>DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York  2002 INVASION: Voted to authorize use of force. Now says her vote was based on flawed information.  TROOP INCREASE: Does not support.  WITHDRAWAL: Supports a phased withdrawal of troops, with some remaining in the region.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware  2002 INVASION: Voted to authorize use of force.  TROOP INCREASE: Says it would be a ''tragic mistake.''  WITHDRAWAL: Advocates phased withdrawal. Supports a partition of Iraq into Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish regions, with a limited central government to handle oil allocation and border security.</p>
        <p>Senator Barack Obama of Illinois  2002 INVASION: Was not yet in the Senate. Says he would have voted against it.  TROOP INCREASE: Does not support.  WITHDRAWAL: Supports a gradual withdrawal. Cautions that a too-rapid departure could lead to a spike in civilian deaths.</p>
        <p>John Edwards, former senator from North Carolina  2002 INVASION: Voted to authorize use of force. Says he now regrets it.  TROOP INCREASE: Does not support.  WITHDRAWAL: Advocates the start of immediate withdrawal of as many as 40,000 troops and rapid turnover of responsibilities to the Iraqis.</p>
