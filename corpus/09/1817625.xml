        <p>A 21-year-old Brooklyn man was fatally shot yesterday evening, two blocks from his home in Flatbush, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Max Raymond, was found shortly after 5 p.m. on East 26th Street near Cortelyou Road, with two bullets in his chest, the police said. He was declared dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>As of last night, investigators said they had no suspects and no motive, but said that a hammer found at the scene may have been used in a fight before the killing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raymond, the father of a 3-year-old girl, had attended Catholic private school and had recently earned a high school equivalency diploma, friends and relatives said. He had a job as a construction worker, but had dreamed of opening a nightclub in Brooklyn, a cousin said.</p>
        <p>Brittany Jackson, 19, who said she was Mr. Raymond's girlfriend, said, ''He's so sweet and loving.'' She pointed to a large crowd of grieving friends who had learned of his death. ''He's always involved in the in-crowd,'' she said. ''Everybody loves him. Everybody loves him so much.''</p>
        <p>Emotions ran high as relatives and friends gathered on the usually quiet one-way residential street where Mr. Raymond was killed. His mother collapsed, screaming, ''My son! My son!''</p>
        <p>His sisters, Shirley and Nanja Raymond, came to their mother's aid, but were pushed against a van on the street, handcuffed by a police officer and taken to the 67th Precinct station house and later released.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Police Department, Sgt. Michael Wysokowski, said that the officers were not aware that the women were Mr. Raymond's sisters and that they had been arrested for crossing the police line and entering the investigation scene. The women were released and their arrests voided after officers learned their identities at the station house, Sergeant Wysokowski said.</p>
