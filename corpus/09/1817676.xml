        <p>The Mets and middle reliever Duaner Sánchez, 27, have agreed to a one-year, $850,000 contract. The agreement was reported by a baseball official who was granted anonymity because details of the deal had not been completed.</p>
        <p>Sánchez, a hard-throwing right-hander who had been eligible for arbitration, was having the best season of his career when he sustained a separated right shoulder in a taxi accident last July in Miami. Sánchez was 5-1 with a 2.60 earned run average in 551/3 innings when he had season-ending shoulder surgery.</p>
