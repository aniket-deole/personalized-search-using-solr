        <p>Don't look for presidential announcements from Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton anytime soon, but stay tuned.</p>
        <p>At least that is the word from their associates. Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, is not likely to say whether he intends to seek the party's presidential nomination until after President Bush's State of the Union address on Jan. 23.

        <p>Don't look for presidential announcements from Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton anytime soon, but stay tuned.</p>
        <p>At least that is the word from their associates. Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, is not likely to say whether he intends to seek the party's presidential nomination until after President Bush's State of the Union address on Jan. 23. As he walked out of the Capitol on a recent afternoon, Mr. Obama only smiled when asked about his timing. Then, he rushed to change the subject.</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Obama said he intended to announce his decision after returning from a holiday vacation in Hawaii, where he was visiting his grandmother and other relatives. Now, several people close to the senator say, he needs a little more time to make up his mind.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Obama has been busy telephoning crucial Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states. There is, of course, only one reason for him to be making such inquiries.</p>
        <p>Last week on Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama bumped into Ethel Kennedy, who has been a big admirer. When asked about him, she said, ''He can't run soon enough.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, plans to announce her decision in the next several weeks, her advisers say. According to several Democrats who have spoken to her, as well as advisers, Mrs. Clinton has given every indication that she is running, short of saying so, and no signals that she is not.</p>
        <p>She is making phone calls to Democratic officials, labor leaders and supporters in early nominating states. And she continues to talk to possible consultants and donors, yet she has not made any travel plans to kick off a campaign.</p>
