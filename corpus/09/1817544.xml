        <p>Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Monday that Iran would not back down from developing its nuclear program, despite sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council last month.</p>
        <p>Ayatollah Khamenei, 67, has the final word on state matters, including nuclear policies.</p>
        <p>He was making his first public appearance since rumors spread on several Web sites on Thursday that he had died.</p>
        <p>''The Iranian people will definitely not give up their right and the authorities have no right to give up this great achievement,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said, addressing a crowd in Qum, 82 miles south of Tehran.</p>
        <p>The Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 with sanctions intended to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes but the United States and some European nations contend is for the purpose of creating nuclear weapons. The measure bars the trade of goods or technology related to Iran's nuclear program. Enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear fuel but also for making nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>The resolution also gave Iran a two-month deadline to halt the program or face tougher sanctions.</p>
        <p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has also brushed off the resolution and vowed that Iran will not suspend the nuclear program.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei also warned neighboring Arab countries not to join an alliance with the United States and Britain against Iran.</p>
        <p>''The nuclear program is a native achievement and is a source of pride for Iran and the Islamic world,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said.</p>
        <p>''If some Arab and Islamic governments think that by joining an alliance with Britain and the United States and imposing sanctions on Iran they can earn the satisfaction of the Zionist regime, they should know that they are making a political blunder,'' he said.</p>
