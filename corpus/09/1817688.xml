        <p>Introduced on Sunday: Nissan Bevel design study</p>
        <p>Is it real? As real as the faux solar panel that's supposed to power a 110-volt tailgate outlet. To be fair, the Bevel probably sets a new standard for the largest blind spot in any vehicle.</p>

        <p>Introduced on Sunday: Nissan Bevel design study</p>
        <p>Is it real? As real as the faux solar panel that's supposed to power a 110-volt tailgate outlet. To be fair, the Bevel probably sets a new standard for the largest blind spot in any vehicle.</p>
        <p>What's the point? Tokyo whimsy; a showcase of ideas that should go no further.</p>
        <p>What they said: Nissan aims the Bevel at men ''entering their second act,'' ages 45-60. According to Nissan's research, these retreads drive alone roughly 90 percent of the time.</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: To its credit, Nissan has discovered a large, previously untapped demographic: lonely, divorced middle-age guys.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? The Bevel features seats that fold to create an easy-to-clean aluminum load floor; a fold-out rear work platform, a ''ribbon'' instrument panel that slides into position and pop-up ''pucks'' on the roof to carry cargo. If none of this makes sense to you, you're not alone.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? We are grateful that the Bevel is strictly a one-shot concept for the show circuit.</p>
        <p>How's it look? The Bevel is a manga Matchbox toy with overtones of a vacuum cleaner attachment, resplendent in a watery yellow-bronze sheen that appears to be a symptom of kidney disease.</p>
