        <p>Introduced on Monday: Changfeng Liebao CS7</p>
        <p>Is it real? Since 1999, Changfeng has been churning out Mitsubishi-based S.U.V.'s and pickups for China and other markets, but not the United States, Japan or Europe. The CS7 is its latest concept S.U.V.</p>

        <p>Introduced on Monday: Changfeng Liebao CS7</p>
        <p>Is it real? Since 1999, Changfeng has been churning out Mitsubishi-based S.U.V.'s and pickups for China and other markets, but not the United States, Japan or Europe. The CS7 is its latest concept S.U.V.</p>
        <p>What's the point? To crush Detroit's spirit and suck out its manufacturing soul. Just kidding -- though automakers in Detroit, Europe and Japan are tripping over themselves to strike partnerships with companies like Changfeng to manufacture cars in China.</p>
        <p>What they said: Liebao means cheetah in Chinese, and as the company's inspiring video noted, ''The cheetahs are leaping into the new century.'' Li Jianxin, the company's chairman, noted Chanfeng's rapid 10-year transformation from a small military repair company to China's No. 1 seller of S.U.V.'s, with more than 23,000 sales in 2006.</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: No word on when Changfeng might cross the Great Wall between</p>
        <p>it and buyers in the United States. Company officials acknowledge the brand must overcome hurdles, including setting up a dealer network and meeting pollution and safety standards.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? A Mitsubishi-derived 2-liter 114-horsepower engine delivers power to a four-wheel-drive system.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? Liebao may sell a similar production model around 2008</p>
        <p>in China, Africa, South America and other markets, for roughly $15,000.</p>
        <p>How's it look? Sitting on the display stand in the cellar of Cobo Hall, it looked like a rejected Kia design, circa 1995, rescued from a Seoul wastebasket and smuggled to Hunan.</p>
