      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi is poised to extinguish one of the last true perquisites of House service: the right to smoke just off the floor in an area known as the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers and aides say they expect that Mrs. Pelosi will soon use the substantial powers of her new office to bar smokers from the lobby and force them outside. Opponents of smoking have complained about the practice for years. The impact of the change will be bipartisan; members of both parties regularly enjoy cigarettes and cigars as they relax in the lobby's leather chairs between votes. The highest ranking smoker is Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and the minority leader, who was perhaps anticipating the change when he headed to an outer balcony last week for a quick cigarette. Ever defiant, some smokers said they would still light up in their personal offices.</p>
