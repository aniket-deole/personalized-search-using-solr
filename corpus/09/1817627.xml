        <p>Q. Why do tiny flying insects form hovering masses in spring and summer?</p>
        <p>A. Think of the swarms as college mixers in miniature, with a highly condensed timeline from introduction to reproduction, entomologists suggest. Like the more familiar swarms of social insects, including termites and bees, swarms of smaller flying insects provide a convenient and efficient mating ground for short-lived young adults.</p>
        <p>In most such swarms, the males wait in a compact mass for receptive females, but in at least one species, the roles are reversed. A 2004 Swedish study in the Journal of Insect Behavior described the mating habits of the species Empis borealis.</p>
        <p>From 1 to 40 females ''gather at landmarks called swarm markers, like trees and bushes, and males carrying an insect prey visit these swarms for mating,'' the researchers wrote.</p>
        <p>''We noticed earlier that some swarm sites were used for several years and that they appeared to be frequented by a similar number of swarming females in each year,'' the report continued.</p>
        <p>Some of the swarm sites were used for 18 years. The swarm sites with the largest number of flies had a high sun exposure during the day and were found at coniferous trees in a mixed forest habitat.</p>
        <p>In general, swarming off the premises of the nest or home territory offers the best chance both for genetic mixing and for finding an appropriate mate in a brief life span.</p>
