        <p>Italians younger than 14 have been barred from Mel Gibson's new film ''Apocalypto'' under a court ruling that overturned a decision by the country's censors that the bloody Maya saga was fit for children, Reuters reported. The ban is temporary, pending a hearing on Jan. 17, according to a lawyer for Codacons, a consumer group that challenged the censors' ruling, which had drawn widespread criticism from politicians and parents organizations last week. In the United States, the film is rated R. The culture minister, Francesco Rutelli, met yesterday with the Italian censorship commission to review its standards.</p>
