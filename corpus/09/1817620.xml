        <p>An American nuclear-powered attack submarine has collided with a Japanese commercial vessel in the Arabian Sea. Initial reports from the area said there were no injuries and only slight damage, a Pentagon spokesman said Monday night.</p>
        <p>The collision, south of the Strait of Hormuz, was first reported by the Kyodo news agency in Japan, which said the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo had been officially notified of the accident by American officials.</p>
        <p>A Pentagon spokesman identified the submarine as the U.S.S. Newport News. The Japanese vessel was thought to be a tanker. American military officials in Washington were seeking a fuller accounting.</p>
        <p>The U.S.S. Newport News is a nuclear-powered, fast-attack submarine in the Los Angeles class of vessels, and was commissioned in 1989, according to Pentagon records.</p>
        <p>The Japanese oil company Showa Shell Sekiyu K. K. said the ship involved is the tanker Mogamigawa, operated by Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., The Associated Press reported, citing a report from the Kyodo news agency. It was traveling from the Persian Gulf to Singapore and was carrying a crew of eight Japanese and 16 Filipinos.</p>
        <p>In February 2001, a United States Navy submarine rammed into a Japanese fishing vessel in waters off Hawaii, killing nine people. The American captain's delay in apologizing for the crash set off protests by the victims' families.</p>
