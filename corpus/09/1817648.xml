        <p>A new human cluster of avian flu cases could be emerging in a suburb of the capital, Jakarta, according to Indonesian news reports. One case of H5N1 flu, the country's 75th, was confirmed by the Health Ministry over the weekend; it was in a 14-year-old boy who had reportedly buried a flock of backyard ducks that died suddenly. He was alive but using a respirator to breathe. A local radio station and news outlets said six other people from the same town -- at least three of them related to him -- were hospitalized with flu symptoms in Jakarta, being treated with Tamiflu and awaiting test results. Indonesia has failed to get its poultry epidemic under control since it emerged in 2005.</p>
