        <p>THE CLAIM -- Hot leftovers should cool at room temperature.</p>
        <p>THE FACTS -- What to do with leftovers? One common bromide is that leftovers stored in the refrigerator must be allowed to cool first at room temperature.</p>
        <p>The reasoning behind the claim varies. One theory is that allowing food to cool at a slower rate reduces the likelihood that it will spoil. Another suggests that hot food can somehow interfere with the circulation of cold air in the refrigerator. The notion may have originated back when food was stored in iceboxes, and thus could not be too hot when put away.</p>
        <p>Whatever the rationale, the claim is wrong. According to the Food and Drug Administration, leftover food (particularly meat) should be refrigerated immediately after serving, and certainly within two hours of cooking.</p>
        <p>Food bacteria can double every 30 or 40 minutes, and several outbreaks of food poisoning have been linked to meat cooked and left to cool at room temperature for too long.</p>
        <p>Generally, the bacteria that contaminate food thrive at temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, so leftovers should always be stored in a refrigerator set at 40 degrees or below.</p>
        <p>When the quantity of food is large, it should be separated into small containers for quicker cooling, and reheated no more than once.</p>
        <p>THE BOTTOM LINE -- It's a bad idea to let food sit at room temperature before refrigerating.</p>
