        <p>Correction on picture caption with Jan 4 review of exhibition at Hostos Community College in Bronx</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An art review on Thursday about the exhibition ''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary,'' at Hostos Community College in the Bronx, omitted a curator. The wall of art hung salon-style was organized by Edwin Ramoran under the title ''Everyday Is Like Sunday''; it is not part of ''Iconoclasm,'' organized by Eddie Torres and hanging in the same room.</p>
        <p>A picture caption with the review misstated the given name of a former director of the Longwood Arts Project who is also one of the curators of the show. As noted in the review, he is Fred Wilson, not Frank.</p>
