        <p>A New Jersey Transit bus driver was arrested last night, suspected of stabbing a passenger during a dispute over the fare, officials said. About 8:50 p.m. a passenger boarded the No. 34 bus, which runs from Newark to Montclair, and began to argue with the driver, a transit company spokesman said. The driver radioed a dispatcher requesting that the police be sent to the scene, but before they s arrived, Mr. Stessel said, the argument escalated, the passenger spit in the driver's face and the driver responded by stabbing the man. The names of the driver and victim were not released last night. The victim was taken to University Hospital in Newark with injuries that were not life threatening, Mr. Stessel said. Officers from Bloomfield and New Jersey Transit were interviewing witnesses last night.</p>
