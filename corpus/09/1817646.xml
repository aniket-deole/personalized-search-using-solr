        <p>Lady Butler-Sloss, the judge presiding over the inquest into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, said at a preliminary hearing that she had not yet decided whether to convene a jury to hear the case. But she said that in any case it would be ''inappropriate'' to empanel a jury made up of members of the royal household, as is the usual custom in deaths that involve the royal family. The inquest -- whose purpose is to determine the identity of the deceased and the time, place and manner of death -- has been delayed by, among other things, long investigations by France and Britain. In a report released last month, the British police concluded that the car crash that killed Diana in Paris in 1997 was a result of an accident caused by a drunk driver, and that it was not a murderous conspiracy. Lady Butler-Sloss said she hoped to schedule the full inquest for the beginning of May at the latest.</p>
