        <p>At least 67 people have been killed in the past four days in attacks in India's troubled northeastern state of Assam. Most of the dead are Hindi-speaking settlers who migrated to the area for work decades ago.</p>
        <p>The police suspect that a separatist rebel group, the United Liberation Front of Assam, is behind the attacks. The group has been fighting since 1979 for independence and for the expulsion of non-Assamese workers who came from outside the region of Assam, the oil-rich and tea-producing state near the Myanmar border.</p>
        <p>Peace talks with the government failed in September, and the government resumed counterinsurgency efforts against the rebels.</p>
        <p>Assam's police chief, R. N. Mathur, said, ''We are patrolling the area heavily, and the situation is tense but under control.''</p>
        <p>It was the worst violence in the region in years, and hundreds of workers were fleeing the area, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The authorities imposed a round-the-clock curfew in the affected districts and sent out police and paramilitary patrols.</p>
