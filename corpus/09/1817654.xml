        <p>A threat to endangered North Atlantic right whales posed by dense arrays of lobster traps, lines and floating buoys off the coast of Maine could be greatly reduced without hurting profits if boats switch to fishing patterns that are the norm in nearby Nova Scotia, according to a study by Canadian and American researchers. The Maine lobster season is year-round, but Canadian lobstermen with far fewer traps have similar catches with a 180-day season, said the authors of the study, published in the journal Current Biology. They said Canadian lobster boats also had lower costs for fuel and bait. The executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association told The Associated Press that almost all traps were set in waters not frequented by the whales.</p>
