        <p>Prime Minister Daniyal Akhmetov resigned. Long considered an influential ally of the powerful president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, who appointed him to the post in 2003, Mr. Akhmetov has lately come under public criticism from Mr. Nazarbayev for poor oversight of the economy. Mr. Nazarbayev, who has been Kazakhstan's president since its inception as an oil-rich independent state in 1991, is known for frequently replacing members of his cabinet.</p>
