        <p>COPPOLA--Rosanne F., a banker who was Global Head of Citibank's worldwide corporate lending and syndications, died January 17 at her home in Jackson, Wyoming. She was 56. Mrs. Coppola began her career at Citibank in 1970 as a clerk in the retail banking branch system, and her professional ascent had many of the characteristics of a Horatio Alger story. She rose quietly through the ranks, each time acquiring greater responsibility. In a highly competitive environment, she was known for fairness, attention to detail and for mentoring those who worked with her. She was an important participant in many of the major transactions of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1998, Mrs. Coppola retired and moved to Wyoming. There, she became an avid and expert skier and marksman, traveling around the country and to Europe during hunting seasons. She was an active member of Our Lady of the Mountains Church, where she served on the finance committee, and she was a director of M &amp; F Worldwide Corporation and Fisher Scientific International, Inc. Rosanne F. Coppola was born in New York on November 1, 1950. She was graduated from Hunter College and received an M.B.A. from Baruch College. She is survived by her husband, Ralph P. Coppola of Jackson, her mother, Rose Feibel, and a sister, Linda M. Feibel, both of Round Top, New York. Services will be private. A memorial service in New York will be announced. For those who wish to honor her memory, contributions to St. Johns Medical Center Foundation would be meaningful and should be addressed to P.O. Box 428, Jackson, WY.</p>
