        <p>Fliers urging white people not to celebrate Martin Luther King's Birthday were left in the driveways of several homes in the Amawalk section of Somers the day before the holiday. But because the fliers did not target or threaten anyone, the state police said they were considered an act of free speech and not a bias crime.</p>
        <p>Wilbur R. Aldridge, regional director for the N.A.A.C.P. in the Mid-Hudson and Westchester region, agreed that the fliers, though obviously racially motivated, seemed to be within the law.</p>
        <p>''I would hope and have to rely upon the intelligence of the people in Somers to realize this was done by somebody who has racist intentions,'' Mr. Aldridge said.</p>
        <p>The fliers were titled ''Embrace Your Race'' and said: ''Wake Up Whites! Do NOT celebrate Martin Luther King Day!''</p>
        <p>A group calling itself North East White Pride had its name on the fliers, and the distribution seemed to be coordinated on the group's Web site, which appears to be a vehicle for white supremacists.</p>
        <p>''We know that racism and discrimination is still alive and well,'' Mr. Aldridge said. ''What they've done is prove that.''</p>
        <p>The investigation remains open as the state police try to learn more about the group. ''We don't often have this in our area,'' said Michael Davis, a state police investigator.</p>
