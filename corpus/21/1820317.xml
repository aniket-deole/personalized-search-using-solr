        <p>Editorial calls on readers to help food kitchens in poor neighborhoods of Connecticut, where lines of needy swell at end of each month as recipients' Social Security or disability funds run out</p>

        <p>Every Thursday, the line forms at the door of the 164 Wilson Food Pantry in Richmond Hill, one of Stamford's poorest neighborhoods, for the pantry's weekly dispersal of groceries to the needy. But the fourth Thursday of the month is usually the toughest, says Joyce Gumbus, the pantry's coordinator. That is when people who struggle to make a Social Security check or a disability check last generally run out of money, and the line winds around the building. Instead of the usual 150 to 200 people who need help, sometimes 300 to 400 show up.</p>
        <p>People do not think of Connecticut, and especially Fairfield County, as a place with pockets of the poor. But it is precisely because the cost of living is so high here that members of the working poor have such a difficult time eking out an existence -- especially if they are paid the minimum wage. Directors of soup kitchens, food pantries and the regional food banks that supply them report that it is utterly ordinary for the poor in Connecticut to have to make a routine choice between paying the rent or going hungry. Too often, they, and their children, go hungry. And with the rise in energy prices in the last several years, demand for food is growing.</p>

        <p>People do not think of Connecticut, and especially Fairfield County, as a place with pockets of the poor. But it is precisely because the cost of living is so high here that members of the working poor have such a difficult time eking out an existence -- especially if they are paid the minimum wage. Directors of soup kitchens, food pantries and the regional food banks that supply them report that it is utterly ordinary for the poor in Connecticut to have to make a routine choice between paying the rent or going hungry. Too often, they, and their children, go hungry. And with the rise in energy prices in the last several years, demand for food is growing.</p>
        <p>The Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County says it distributed 968,000 pounds of food last year. This winter has been relatively mild, freeing up more money for groceries. Yet those who help the poor know that with colder weather this past week, they will be especially busy -- and donors will not have the holidays to remind them to bring a bag of groceries or a check to help those less fortunate.</p>
        <p>Hunger does not fade once the wreaths come down. Those who believe in generosity no matter what the season might check into their local food pantries and ask how full the shelves are.</p>
