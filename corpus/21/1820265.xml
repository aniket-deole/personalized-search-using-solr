        <p>To the Editor: Gregory Dicum's ''Big Sur Without the Crowds'' (Jan. 7) brought back memories of my father, Guido Teunissen, a postwar Dutch immigrant who found his true home in America at Big Sur, as did Henry Miller. Guido moved to Big Sur in the early 1960s, during its heyday of unspoiled bohemianism (alas, after my mother and I had left him). He was a master craftsman who helped to build Esalen at its founding. When reading of the ''snuggle perch'' and ''carved benches'' that are ''set just so,'' I like to think that my father was responsible for some of the whimsy Mr. Dicum found at Esalen. On his deathbed in 1997, Guido thought he was back in Big Sur. Although his body was not there, his soul surely was.</p>
