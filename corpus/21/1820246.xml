        <p>On the calendar of network television we're entering return-from-hiatus season. This week brings the resumption of the serials ''PRISON BREAK'' on Fox (Monday, 8 p.m.) and ''HEROES'' on NBC (Monday, 9 p.m.). ''Heroes'' has not been the best of last fall's new shows -- acting, apparently, is not an ability subject to enhancement through genetic mutation -- but it has been the most entertaining. Monday's episode is light on action, as story lines are recapped and characters are shuffled around to set up future derring-do, but there is an amusing scene set at the American Museum of Natural History involving Hiro, Ando and a samurai sword.</p>
        <p>Another show that returns this week, after an even longer hiatus, is the guilty-pleasure sitcom ''GEORGE LOPEZ''  (Wednesday, 8 p.m.). It ended last April with the police arriving to arrest George's mother; it picks up with George leading them to her and delivering the show's first joke in nine months: ''In case she tries to run, don't bother with the pepper spray. We're Mexican. ''</p>
        <p>''OPRAH'S ROOTS: AN AFRICAN AMERICAN LIVES SPECIAL'' (Wednesday night on most PBS stations; check local listings) is an expanded version of a segment from the PBS series ''African American Lives,'' which Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times called ''the most exciting and stirring documentary on any subject to appear on television in a long time'' when it was shown last February. The scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. enlists genealogists, historians and biochemists (and presumably several underpaid production assistants) to research Ms. Winfrey's ancestry.</p>
