        <p>Morley's athletic gifts afforded him a rare second chance at academic success. Instead of learning from his mistakes in high school, he chose to repeat them at the collegiate level.</p>
        <p>While Tennessee's motives for affording the opportunity are debatable, the end result is that the university gave Morley the chance to succeed both on the field and in the classroom.</p>
        <p>The system may have failed Morley, but Morley also failed himself.</p>
