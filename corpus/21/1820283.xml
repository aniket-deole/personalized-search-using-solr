        <p>Even though this winter has been less than frigid, soup is still a draw at Kozy Kettle in Huntington Village. Shoppers, parents with strollers and local business people line up at the counter at this spare, self-service cafe for fresh salads ($2.35 to $7.49), wraps ($6.99) and a weekly selection of 15 soups.</p>
        <p>The menu includes stew, chowder and chili recipes distilled from nine years of experiments at the stove. ''Most people like their soups chunky so it's more filling,'' said the owner, Richard Kalender. ''Our soups are like a meal.''</p>

        <p>Even though this winter has been less than frigid, soup is still a draw at Kozy Kettle in Huntington Village. Shoppers, parents with strollers and local business people line up at the counter at this spare, self-service cafe for fresh salads ($2.35 to $7.49), wraps ($6.99) and a weekly selection of 15 soups.</p>
        <p>The menu includes stew, chowder and chili recipes distilled from nine years of experiments at the stove. ''Most people like their soups chunky so it's more filling,'' said the owner, Richard Kalender. ''Our soups are like a meal.''</p>
        <p>Try the velvety butternut squash soup with chunks of McIintosh apples or the spicy Southwestern grilled chicken chowder, studded with kernels of corn and smoky roasted peppers. The soups are priced at $5.99 for 12 ounces, $6.49 for 16 ounces and $12.75 for 32 ounces, with the exception of the lush lobster chowder, which is slightly more expensive.</p>
        <p>For those watching their calories, Kozy Kettle offers a good vegetarian Tuscan minestrone, three-bean veggie chili and a light, flavorful chicken noodle soup with chunks of carrots and celery in a low-salt broth.</p>
        <p>Each soup comes with a warm popover, one of those old-fashioned, bonnet-shaped bread puddings that are crisp and brown on the outside, moist and airy within, and fine for dunking in a full-flavored stew.</p>
        <p>The unadorned, brightly lighted storefront has room for only three tables and eight counter stools, but takeout business is brisk. At night, Kalender said, ''husbands come in calling their wives on their cellphones to see what they want them to bring home for dinner.''</p>
        <p>Kozy Kettle, 366 New York Avenue, Huntington Village; (631) 547-5388. Open Monday to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Sunday, noon to 6 p.m.</p>
