        <p>Re ''Building a Stairway to Paradise, for Your Beloved Pet'' (Jan. 14), which described big spending on burial sites for dogs and cats:</p>
        <p>If people are going to part with such a huge amount of money, why don't they instead donate it to a humane organization, in the name of their pets? Because so many pets end up in shelters, one could direct the money toward programs that foster responsible pet ownership, spaying and neutering. And because so many pets suffer from abuse, one could consider donating to law enforcement initiatives.</p>

        <p>Someday, when my dog is nearing the end of his life, I will spend money to ensure that he is comfortable, pain-free and loved, right up to the very second he begins his ascent up that stairway. Anything after that is a waste.</p>
        <p>Owners should consider that a dog does not care about burial rituals. He just wants to be loved and taken care of by his master while he's alive.</p>
