        <p>''Presenting the Arts to New Audiences'' (Jan. 7) underscored how the new demographics of the suburbs are stimulating programming by arts organizations to engage diverse groups in their communities. Folklife initiatives are now uniting ethnic groups across suburban regions and generating original field research by professional folklorists to identify traditional artists and sustain their traditions, among recently arrived as well as established residents.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Presenting the Arts to New Audiences'' (Jan. 7) underscored how the new demographics of the suburbs are stimulating programming by arts organizations to engage diverse groups in their communities. Folklife initiatives are now uniting ethnic groups across suburban regions and generating original field research by professional folklorists to identify traditional artists and sustain their traditions, among recently arrived as well as established residents.</p>
        <p>Suburban folk arts programs have joined to present Asian Indian music and dance through concerts and educational workshops in Westchester and on Long Island. Folklorists have documented and presented boat building traditions of the Great South Bay and the South Fork; calligraphy, paper cutting and sacred arts of multiple ethnic groups; and Latino traditions in exceptionally diverse Rockland County.</p>
        <p>Since 1985, such projects have been made possible through the strong commitment of the New York State Council on the Arts to its Folk Arts Program, which has developed and supported over 2,000 community-based projects. The program provides funds for a thriving network of 13 ongoing regional programs along with apprenticeships, exhibitions, concerts, festivals and documentation projects.</p>

        <p>This letter was also signed by representatives of the Westchester Arts Council, the Historical Society of Rockland County and the New York State Council on the Arts.</p>
