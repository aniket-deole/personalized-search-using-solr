      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Park Slope Town House  $3,450,000  BROOKLYN: 598 Second Street (near Prospect Park West)  One block from Prospect Park, a meticulously restored and updated brownstone, 19 by 45 feet, with a 20-foot extension on two floors. All original ornate wood and plaster detail is intact. The house has five bedrooms, three baths, two gas fireplaces, central air, a yard and a tiled deck. Ellen Blau, Warren Lewis Realty (917) 597-2274; www.warrenlewis.com.  TAXES: $5,944 a year  PROS: An admirable blend of old and new, this quintessential Victorian brownstone has recently been upgraded with steam-shower baths and an ultramodern eat-in kitchen.  CONS: Although the house could be converted to a triplex with a garden rental, a kitchen would have to be installed on the parlor floor.</p>
        <p>Upper East Side Two-Bedroom  $1,975,000  MANHATTAN: 201 East 62nd Street (between Second and Third Avenues), #19D  A two-bedroom, two-and-half-bath co-op with a fireplace and a terrace in a doorman building. Michelle Cadden, Halstead Property (212) 381-2209; www.halstead.com  MAINTENANCE: $2,731 a month, plus $347 a month for electricity  PROS: The apartment has eastern, western and northern views, and the rooms flow well off a large foyer. The kitchen is well designed and opens onto a large dining room. The master bedroom has two cedar-lined walk-in closets.  CONS: Maintenance is on the high side, and the building requires a 50 percent down payment.</p>
        <p>A House for Swimmers  $799,000  CONNECTICUT: 8 Shady Lane, Redding  A four-bedroom, three-bath colonial on two acres with a family room with vaulted ceiling, newer kitchen, two-car attached garage and 32-by-16-foot indoor pool. Marilyn Sloper, Coldwell Banker Shaker (877) 463-1431; www.marilynsloper.com  TAXES: $9,600 a year  PROS: The pool enclosure has a fireplace and conveniently adjoins a basement-level game room/bar, with a full bath and laundry room down the hall.  CONS: There is no bathroom on the main floor.</p>
        <p>Upper West Side One-Bedroom  $619,000  MANHATTAN: 125 West 96th Street (between Columbus and Amsterdam), #6D  A one-bedroom, one-bath condo in a prewar elevator building that was first listed at $649,000. Alan Nickman, Bellmarc Realty (212) 874-0100, ext. 209; www.bellmarc.com  MAINTENANCE: $844 a month  PROS: The bedroom is roomy and has a large walk-in closet. Charming prewar details include beautiful hardwood floors, arched entryways and built-in shelves in the foyer. The kitchen was recently renovated.  CONS: The building's common spaces could use some attention.</p>
        <p>Expanded Center-Hall Colonial  $1,899,000  NASSAU: 106 John Street, Garden City  An updated 1917 brick home with five bedrooms and three and a half baths on a wide street lined with mature trees and well-maintained homes.

Margarita Chavez and John Russo, Coach Realtors (516) 384-4552; www.coachrealtors.com  TAXES: $21,506 a year  PROS: The house is within walking distance of downtown shops and the train station.
