        <p>There are investigations by Congress, the inspector general at Interior and the Justice Department into alleged mismanagement, poor oversight of oil companies and possibly even criminal misbehavior.</p>
        <p>The agency is also accused of lax oversight of oil company payments. Four of its own auditors have accused superiors of blocking findings that major companies cheated the government. Mr. Devaney criticized the enforcement efforts, saying they rely heavily on unverified reports by oil companies -- ''an honor system,'' he told lawmakers Thursday. Here is a guide to investigations at the Interior Department.</p>
