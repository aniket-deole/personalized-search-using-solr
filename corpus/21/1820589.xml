        <p>Obviously, no one can know for certain why Andre Waters ended his life. But there are certainly other possible explanations for his depression.

        <p>Re ''Expert Ties Ex-Player's Suicide to Brain Damage From Football,'' Jan 18:</p>
        <p>Obviously, no one can know for certain why Andre Waters ended his life. But there are certainly other possible explanations for his depression. A majority of retired football players suffer from chronic pain as a result of injuries, and many people with this problem are depressed and even suicidal.</p>
        <p>Most retired players fade into obscurity, a potentially difficult journey for someone who has been the center of attention and received the adulation of millions.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Now that the invaluable work of Chris Nowinski and Dr. Bennet Omalu has made football fans aware of the damage players can suffer, I hope they will never again confuse the seemingly choreographed ballet of television with the helmet-crushing, neuron-damaging mayhem that takes place on the field.</p>
        <p>After reading this article, I have lost my taste for football.</p>
