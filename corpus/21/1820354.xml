        <p>KINDERKAMACK ROAD is the spine of north-central Bergen County -- an 11-mile strip of commercial and residential miscellany connecting at least half a dozen mini-downtowns like that of Park Ridge, which go by in a blink if you hit the traffic lights correctly. Who would figure that one of those anonymous-looking converted frame houses, wedged between a funeral home and a diner, would hold a terrific New American steakhouse?</p>
        <p>Not too many people, apparently, because the Park Steakhouse has been cruising under the fine-dining radar since it opened three and a half years ago.

        <p>KINDERKAMACK ROAD is the spine of north-central Bergen County -- an 11-mile strip of commercial and residential miscellany connecting at least half a dozen mini-downtowns like that of Park Ridge, which go by in a blink if you hit the traffic lights correctly. Who would figure that one of those anonymous-looking converted frame houses, wedged between a funeral home and a diner, would hold a terrific New American steakhouse?</p>
        <p>Not too many people, apparently, because the Park Steakhouse has been cruising under the fine-dining radar since it opened three and a half years ago. It has received hardly any reviews and has generated none of the excitement that attends better-publicized heavy hitters like Roots in Summit and Avenue in Long Branch (to name two of many).</p>
        <p>Yet the Park's chef and co-owner, John A. Halligan, 45, is the real thing -- a veteran of high-style hotel dining rooms in Manhattan who has received many awards. Like other city chefs who moved to the suburbs (in this case, nearby River Vale) to raise a family, Mr. Halligan discovered a preference for the slower lane. Luckily for Bergen County, that slower lane is Kinderkamack Road.</p>
        <p>When he set up the Park (renovating a far less ambitious restaurant of the same name), Mr. Halligan imported a room-size refrigerator for dry-aging beef. He has the red-meat thing down pat, turning out gorgeous hunks of certified Black Angus that will satisfy anyone's atavistic cravings.</p>
        <p>The Park's $42 porterhouse, in particular, would be a contender in any steakstakes: a pound and a half of highly tender New York strip and filet mignon, served on the bone, with a fine mineral flavor that speaks of three weeks of aging. While it just about covers its large plate, there's room for a small but satisfying haystack of crunchy shoestring potatoes -- meaning that ordering a separate side dish, imperative at many steakhouses, is not so necessary here. (Although the onion rings are sensational.)</p>
        <p>Nor was there anything to fault in the other steaks we tried: a 12-ounce filet mignon, a two-inch-thick New York sirloin and an off-menu special, rib-eye, which came with well-executed accompaniments of mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. But in the end, steak is steak; once you attain a certain level of quality, it's hard to separate one steakhouse from another. What makes the Park interesting is everything else.</p>
        <p>For example, sushi, which is offered in one appetizer at each meal. Mr. Halligan says he learned the craft on a five-month trip to Japan, and he turns out a mean tuna roll, with just the right balance of rice, seaweed and first-rate fish. Even better were sweet bay scallops, served in their shells and balanced by a restrained vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>And even better than the sushi was a starter of two large sea scallops with foie gras, gently saut√©ed, combined with white-truffle vinaigrette and then thrust into tiny superheated cast-iron pans. They arrived at the table smoking and fragrant, making a spectacular entrance.</p>
        <p>Basil-pesto risotto came with a nice bonus alongside it: crabmeat with lemon-butter sauce. The obligatory $16 foie gras appetizer had a Christmas-dinner accompaniment of spiced gingerbread and apple-cranberry chutney. And butternut-squash bisque with a pleasing edge of ginger held a little island of short-rib ragout, sweetened (but not too much) with maple syrup.</p>
        <p>Nonsteak entrees were less inventive but satisfying, notably seared halibut over baby bok choy (now listed on the menu with oxtail ragout and red-wine butter sauce). Roasted duck -- the breast sharp and gamy, the leg rich and mild -- came with braised cabbage, Calvados reduction and a little cup of sweet-corn custard. The only disappointment was braised short ribs in a dark Guinness stout sauce that was oddly short on flavor.</p>
        <p>To my taste, the best dessert was the cheese platter, enough for four people, with five generous samples that ran the gamut from sharp and firm to mild and creamy. Unfortunately, it was a chore to get our dour, impatient server to identify them. The waiter on our other visit was friendly and down to earth, and the Park is like that -- a sophisticated restaurant in local-joint clothing, where, as Mr. Halligan told me, ''landscapers in flannel shirts sit there eating foie gras.'' Now, there's democracy in action.</p>

        <p>VERY GOOD</p>
        <p>THE SPACE Comfortable, though hardly lavish -- a neighborhood restaurant with a large bar, an 80-seat dining room and a lower level with 60 more seats. The main room and the restrooms are wheelchair-accessible.  THE CROWD Casual but well-heeled couples and foursomes.  THE STAFF Generally friendly, accommodating and well trained.  THE BAR A 200-bottle wine list, on the expensive side.  THE BILL Lunch entrees, $21 to $38. Dinner entrees, $24 to $42. All major credit cards.  WHAT WE LIKE Butternut squash soup, sushi, sizzling sea scallops, risotto; all steaks, halibut, roasted duck; cheese plate, banana upside-down cake.  IF YOU GO Lunch: Monday to Friday, noon to 3 p.m. Dinner: daily, 5 to 10 p.m. Reservations recommended (necessary on weekends). On-street parking is limited; the restaurant offers valet parking.
