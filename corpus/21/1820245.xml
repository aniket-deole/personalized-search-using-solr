        <p>The ancient Greeks were arguably the first to use theater to create dialogue about war and other weighty matters. So Sophocles' ''Antigone,'' written in 441 B.C., seems particularly timely yet again as it confronts the futility of war and the price a ruler pays for excessive pride -- or, as the Greeks termed it, hubris. ''THE BURIAL AT THEBES'' is a modern adaptation of ''Antigone'' by SEAMUS HEANEY, the Nobel Prize-winning Irish poet. The version of the text published in 2004 includes a note from the author drawing parallels between Creon and the Bush administration. A few years later we are still at war, and the play is still timely. Alexander Harrington directs. Thursday through Feb. 12, La MaMa, First Floor Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $18.</p>
        <p>Uptown on the night that work opens, another Irish writer takes center stage when Brian Friel's ''TRANSLATIONS,'' now in previews, has its official opening. Mr. Friel's 1980 play about native Irish culture being wiped away by the steady and unapologetic march of imperialism seems appropriate today as well. In the fictional town of Ballybeg in 1833, the British are remapping and renaming every hill and dale with English words, thus declaring ownership of the land while simultaneously treading on national pride. Garry Hynes (''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') directs. Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com; $39.25 to $86.25.</p>
        <p>War still on your mind? Head back downtown to catch the Incumbo Theater Company's revival of James McLure's dark 1979 comedy, ''PVT. WARS,'' about three Vietnam War veterans struggling with physical and emotional injuries. After the Feb. 3 performance audience members can participate in a discussion about military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with veterans of each conflict. Thursday through Feb. 18, Gene Frankel Theater, 24 Bond Street, between Lafayette Street and the Bowery, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smartix.com; $18.</p>
