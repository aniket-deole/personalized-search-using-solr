        <p>Among its many capital improvement projects, New Jersey Transit is considering introducing a train line that would run from Manhattan and Hoboken to Scranton, Pa., along the Route 80 corridor.</p>
        <p>Called the Lackawanna Cutoff, the proposed line is an 88-mile stretch of level ground that was once used by the Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad and later by Conrail, which abandoned its right of way more than two decades ago and removed the tracks. New Jersey Transit bought the land in 2001.</p>

        <p>Among its many capital improvement projects, New Jersey Transit is considering introducing a train line that would run from Manhattan and Hoboken to Scranton, Pa., along the Route 80 corridor.</p>
        <p>Called the Lackawanna Cutoff, the proposed line is an 88-mile stretch of level ground that was once used by the Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad and later by Conrail, which abandoned its right of way more than two decades ago and removed the tracks. New Jersey Transit bought the land in 2001.</p>
        <p>''We're advancing this project, including public meetings this month,'' said Joe Dee, a New Jersey Transit spokesman. The plan has a projected cost of $551 million, not including the purchase of property for stations. An environmental assessment and conceptual design are due this year.</p>
        <p>The Lackawanna Cutoff line would employ diesel-powered trains and have stops in Andover and Blairstown in New Jersey and Analomink, the Delaware Water Gap, East Stroudsburg, Pocono Mountain, Scranton and Tobyhanna in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>It is not clear when service could begin. ''A timeline for future phases of the project will be contingent on funding availability,'' Mr. Dee said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dee said that the departure of George D. Warrington, who has said he is stepping down as executive director of New Jersey Transit at the end of March, would have no effect on the Lackawanna Cutoff project.</p>
