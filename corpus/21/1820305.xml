        <p>The name of the shop, the Cooking Company, sounds fairly mundane, but this extensive specialty-food supply store is anything but ordinary. Among the daily choices are 2 freshly made soups, like tomato Asiago or white bean and escarole, and 12 different sandwiches, including grilled panini (a favorite combination: smoked turkey, Gorgonzola, pesto and roasted red peppers).</p>
        <p>Four or five salads are also part of the daily mix. The many rotating options include bow-tie pasta with Asiago cheese in a lemon dressing; carrot and golden raisins, yellow rice and black beans; and Greek and Cobb salads. Most popular is the chicken Caesar pasta salad.</p>

        <p>The name of the shop, the Cooking Company, sounds fairly mundane, but this extensive specialty-food supply store is anything but ordinary.

        <p>Inside, the Cooking Company seats just eight (there is additional seating out front in warm weather). But a chef, pastry chef and two assistants turn out a good number of luscious dishes to go, including walnut-crusted pork loin with a mustard cream sauce, and many comfort foods, like chicken potpie, chicken enchiladas and various lasagnas.</p>
        <p>Desserts are a big deal here, said the owner, Susan Bauer, citing the peanut chocolate mousse cake, hazelnut mousse cake and coconut cake with passion-fruit mousse as being especially popular. Virtually everything is made in-house except the breads, which are from Fabled Foods in Deep River.</p>
        <p>Aside from all the goodies to enjoy at lunchtime, the Cooking Company also sells delicatessen items like Genoa salami, maple-smoked turkey and spicy capicola hams. A freezer offers prepared-ahead frozen dishes and a refrigerator features dishes ready to heat up at home for dinner. There is a coffee bar near the entrance with Daybreak coffees and a second room stocked with all kinds of gourmet goodies, including vinegars, olive oils, unusual jams, other preserves and various comestibles.</p>
        <p>The Cooking Company, Swing Bridge Market Place, 1610 Sabrook Road, Haddam; (860) 345-8008. Open 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday.</p>
