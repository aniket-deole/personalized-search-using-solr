        <p>In an age when the mantle of outsider can seem like just another fashionable pose, the OUTSIDER ART FAIR in the Puck Building has a quaint ring to it. But this 15-year-old fair can still provide the unexpected. It includes a daunting sample of paintings by self-taught hobbyists, eccentrics and the clinically insane. And although the work is notoriously uneven, it remains a welcome counterpoint to the increasingly predictable slickness of the contemporary art scene. Friday through Jan. 28, 295 Lafayette Street, SoHo, (212) 777-5218.</p>
        <p>Those searching for a more ethereal experience should take a trip to ''LACE AND SUBVERSIVE KNITTING'' at the Museum of Arts and Design, an exhibition that bridges the divide between high art and low craft. The show, which groups together 27 artists from seven countries, offers a range of works with different sensibilities, from a tiny pair of red mittens by the artist Althea Merback to Janet Echelman's enormous diaphanous webs, whose soft, billowing forms shift delicately in the wind. Through June 17, 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-3535.</p>
        <p>By comparison ''PRIVATE TREASURES: FOUR CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTER DRAWINGS,'' at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum, should be a comfort to those who prefer a more comfortingly classical art experience. On display are weighty 16th-century masterpieces like Agnolo Bronzino's ''Study of the Dead Christ.'' But pay particular attention to Watteau's delicious sketch of a man playing a guitar, as well as François-André Vincent's ''Drawing Lesson,'' with its undertones of sexual tension. Through April 8, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008.</p>
