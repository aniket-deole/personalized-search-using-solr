        <p>Joining a small but growing number of corporate chiefs, J. W. Marriott Jr., chairman and chief executive of Marriott International, entered the blogosphere last week with ''Marriott on the Move'' (www.blogs.marriott.com).</p>
        <p>In his first post, Mr. Marriott, 74, said he was ''not very good with computers,'' though he said he was hooked to his cellphone and, thanks to his grandchildren, to his iPod.</p>
        <p>In an old-fashioned telephone interview, he said some blog ideas would come from Marriott's employees, but the answers would be his own. ''I'm heavily involved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said he would discuss Marriott's history and political issues like immigration reform.</p>
        <p>But he was unsure about criticizing the company.</p>
        <p>''I haven't thought about that yet,'' he said. ''I can't say whether I will or not.''</p>
