        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Though cultivating new audiences for jazz is a laudable goal, there is a growing cultural disconnect because swing has become irrelevant. By focusing solely on the music and ignoring its meaning, we are missing the larger opportunity to teach improvisation as a life skill. This was brought home to me by the late, great Lester Bowie. When I mentioned that most of the students in my college jazz ensemble were not music majors, Lester replied, ''When you're being operated on, do you want a doctor who knows how to improvise or not?''</p>
