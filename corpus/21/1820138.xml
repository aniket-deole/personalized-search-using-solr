        <p>BUCHWALD--Art. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University mourns the loss of Art Buchwald, a very special supporter, who was invaluable to us from the very beggining. I mourn the loss of a very dear friend with whom I shared many meals, Redskin football games, and laughter, and who lit up many Easters for my children Mark, Joe, and Claudia, and special birthdays for my wife Hilary and me. We all love him and our hearts and prayers go to his family. Joseph A Califano, Jr. $(6$)BUCHWALD--ART, Art Buchwald was a man of great heart and wit. He had an incredible gift for making people laugh themselves silly as he poked fun at them. And for making everyone feel very much at home. Art was a good friend to me and my company. Over a quarter of a century ago, Art Buchwald was Master of Ceremonies at the annual events North American Watch Company hosted. For more than fifteen years, Art, the revered, Pulitzer Prize winning American humorist and political satirist, introduced our keynote speakers--towering figures who greatly influenced our times. From Henry Kissinger, Ted Kennedy and Bob Hope, to Walter Cronkite, Ronald Reagan and Alexander Haig, Art cast each one in a wry, humorous light. I know Art enjoyed these events because every time I ran into him over the years, he'd bring them up, making us both laugh aloud all over again. Art, we will all miss your insightful humor and joy of life. We celebrate your spirit as we mourn your loss. Gerry Grinberg and the Grinberg and Movado Group families</p>
