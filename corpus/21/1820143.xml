        <p>EXELBY--Phillip R., M.D. The Departments of Pediatrics and Surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center mourn the passing of Phillip R. Exelby, M.D. Dr. Exelby was Chief of the Pediatric Surgical Service from 1971-1996, the Acting Chairman of Pediatrics from 1982 - 1986, and Member, Emeritus of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center. A graduate of Queens College, Oxford and the University College Hospital Medical School, he joined the Department of Surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1966. As an American Cancer Society Fellow, he pursued advanced training in pediatric surgery at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington and at Columbia University, returning to Memorial Hospital to lead a new surgical service focussed on childhood maligancies. He was a pioneer in the development of new surgical techniques permitting effective removal of malignant tumors from vital organs. He also spearheaded new treatments integrating surgery with chemotherapy and radiotherapy which have increased cure rates and prevented damage to normal organs in young children. He accomplished much, publishing over 120 papers on his work, training leaders in the field of surgical onocolgy, and securing the lives of hundreds of children, now grown to adulthood, who once had cancer. Through his work with the American Cancer Society, he led national efforts to improve treatments for children with cancer. Following his retirement, Dr. Exelby continued this work, establishing treatment programs for children with cancer and chronic infections at Bangkok University and, more recently, treating victims of the tsunami. Dr. Exelby was a gifted surgeon, and a caring physician, whose wisdom, skill, infectious humor, and extraordinary humanity enriched us all. He will be dearly missed.</p>
