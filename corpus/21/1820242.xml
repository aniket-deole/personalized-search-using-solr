        <p>Studio performances presented this week by the MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP will make it possible to see the work up close and personal. But Mr. Morris's dances and dancers have almost always looked that way, from the early days at the tiny Dance Theater Workshop to later shows at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The gleaming Mark Morris Dance Center is just across Lafayette Avenue from the academy, and it is there that the company will present a new piece set to Bach's Italian Concerto, as well as ''The Argument,'' ''Sang-Froid'' and ''Love Song Waltzes,'' Tuesday through Saturday. The program and assorted other events are Mr. Morris's way of welcoming in the new year. 3 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (212) 352-3101, mmdg.org; $40.</p>
        <p>Christopher d'Amboise's ''Tribute,'' which will be danced by the NEW YORK CITY BALLET for the first time on Saturday night, pays homage to the City Ballet co-founder Lincoln Kirstein in the centenary year of his birth. The ballet will be danced by some of the company's most vivid young performers, dancers of the sort Kirstein would have watched and championed as they progressed through the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, one of his pet projects. It is part of a program called ''Tribute to Kirstein,'' which also includes George Balanchine's ''Episodes'' and ''Vienna Waltzes.'' Saturday at 8 p.m., also Jan. 31 at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $30 to $82.</p>
