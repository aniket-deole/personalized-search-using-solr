        <p>AFTER being housed for 20 years in an old junior high school building in Huntington, the Touro Law Center has relocated to a 180,000-square-foot campus in Central Islip. Classes began on Tuesday for the 750 law students in a new building, adjacent to the Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse and the John P. Cohalan Jr. court complex.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Raful, the dean of the Touro Law Center, said the school's move to Central Islip is part of the village's master plan to redevelop the area.</p>
        <p>''The area is booming and bringing new life to Central Islip,'' he said. ''With federal and state courthouses as our new neighbors, we form a triangle of three important and complementary legal institutions.''</p>
        <p>The four-story law school building, which cost $35 million and is on property Touro bought 10 years ago, includes two trial classrooms, a moot courtroom/auditorium that seats 500, a four-story library and a public advocacy wing that provides space for 14 nonprofit advocacy groups. The law school anticipates reaching agreements with groups that work, for example, on immigration, environmental and housing issues; they would get free rent in return for working with the college's students.</p>
        <p>''These groups will have access to Touro's law students, who in turn will receive hands-on training,'' said Mr. Raful, who called the advocacy program unique among law schools in the country.</p>
        <p>The law school's new curriculum, approved by the faculty last year, is a court participation program. First-year students will see cases moving through the courts, and third-year students will try mock cases in real courtrooms before actual judges, Mr. Raful said. ''Other law schools have clinics,'' he said, ''but nothing like this, which is more like a medical school model.''</p>
        <p>The Touro Law Center was established in 1980 as part of Touro College. After spending its first few years in Manhattan, the law school moved to Long Island.</p>
