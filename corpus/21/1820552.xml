        <p>It was an unusual deal to begin with -- too unusual, according to the state.</p>
        <p>An audit released this month by the state comptroller's office struck down a five-year-old agreement in which the Town of Greenburgh funnels $650,000 a year to the Valhalla Union Free School District to allow a homeless shelter in the Mayfair-Knollwood neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Some residents and at least one town board member objected to the deal, saying that all of Greenburgh's residents should benefit. The comptroller's office agreed, saying the deal furthered only the school district's purposes, not the town's.</p>
        <p>The Greenburgh supervisor, Paul J. Feiner, said he was disappointed that a deal he considered good for everyone would have to be reworked. ''I thought this could have been a model,'' he said. ''Instead of 'Not in my backyard,' it's 'Yes, in my backyard.' ''</p>
        <p>But he said he was optimistic that a new agreement could be reached. One solution offered by the audit would be for the shelter, WestHelp, to give the money directly to the school district instead of to the town.</p>
        <p>The 108-unit shelter was originally supposed to stay open for 10 years, but the neighborhood agreed to a 10-year extension, with the provision that the school district and local fire department receive financial assistance. The Fairview Fire District receives $100,000 a year, which was not addressed in the audit. The town gets an additional $473,000 a year.</p>
        <p>''I can't think of any other community that would voluntarily agree to have a homeless shelter in their community,'' Mr. Feiner said.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Belinsky, president of HELP USA, the national group that runs the shelter, said he did not think ''the transaction was fatally flawed.''</p>
        <p>''The burden now rests on the town and town board on how they wish to proceed,'' he said.</p>
