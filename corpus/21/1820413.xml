        <p>Lately, fashion in New York has been a high-wire act. The seasons have been changing so fast you would think winter and spring were running a marathon.

Then, two days later, winter sprinted ahead, and women bundled up to resemble the polar bear window at the decorator Linda Horn's antiques shop on the Upper East Side. On Friday, snow coated the park and capped the daffodils.</p>
