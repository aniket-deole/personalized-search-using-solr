        <p>MAGNOR--Michael Edward, a former resident of 101 Erledon Road, Tenafly, NJ for over 50 years, and Palm Beach Gardens, FL, died at his home on Sunday, January 14, 2007 at the age of 95. Mr. Magnor was employed by Underwood Mortgage &amp; Title Company for forty years, spending the last decade as its president, retiring in 1976. He was a well known and active member of the New Jersey financial community throughout his distinguished career. In addition to his role at Underwood Mortgage &amp; Title, Mr. Magnor was recognized by his peers as a trusted colleague and forward-thinking leader, serving as President of the Mortgage Bankers Association and as President of the Society of Residential Appraisers. He was also an avid golfer and lifelong member of Knickobocker Country Club in Tenafly. His wife of 63 years, Mildred Schuessler Magnor died a year ago at the age of 93. Their life together served as a model of devotion and partnership to their friends and loving family, which includes their three children, Linda M. Flynn of New York, NY; Janice M. Feldman of McLean, Virginia; and Michael E. Magnor Jr. of Southampton, New York; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. A Memorial Service will be planned later in the year in Tenafly, New Jersey. Contributions can be made in memory of Michael E. Magnor to The Alzheimer Association, 225 North Michigan Ave. Floor 17, Chicago, IL, 60601-7633.</p>
