      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>WHAT WAS IT? The Citroën SM of 1970-75, the front-wheel-drive offspring of a French-Italian marriage. Fewer than 13,000 were made before the fuel crisis killed the market for fast coupes.</p>
        <p>WHAT'S IN A NAME? SM stood for Systeme Maserati, not sado-masochist, although that is an apt description of anyone who buys a less-than-perfect SM.</p>
        <p>AND THE POINT WAS? The SM was the first fruit of a short-lived Citroën-Maserati merger. The car had an expediently designed V-6 -- the Maserati Bora's V-8 with two cylinders lopped off.</p>
        <p>WHAT MADE IT MEMORABLE? Unique-to-Citroën hydraulics controlled the brakes, steering and suspension; a hydaulic breakdown could result in the loss of these crucial subsystems. The SM had no fewer than 14 warnings clustered around a large red light frighteningly labeled ''STOP.'' While the ride was remarkably smooth, the steering and brakes could be terrifying. The brakes, actuated by a pressure-sensitive ''magic mushroom'' button on the floor, were incredibly touchy; the steering was so direct that a sneeze could send you into the next lane.</p>
        <p>WHY BE CAUTIOUS? When an SM breaks -- and it will -- good luck finding a mechanic willing to tackle the job. Opening the hood is like performing an alien autopsy in Area 51: there are things in there that you cannot identify.</p>
        <p>THE ADS SAID: Like the Infiniti campaign two decades later, the SM came with poetry. But in this case, the words were unintentionally hysterical (and bordered on soft-core pornography). Consider this example:</p>
        <p>''Trust the SM.</p>
        <p>You'd be surprised</p>
        <p>What a machine can do</p>
        <p>When it knows</p>
        <p>You believe in it.</p>
        <p>Easy on the steering wheel</p>
        <p>Handle it gently</p>
        <p>Don't overwhelm the SM</p>
        <p>It will do what you want it to.</p>
        <p>The Citroën Maserati is happiest,</p>
        <p>Will do its best for you</p>
        <p>When it's trusted.</p>
        <p>A love affair with the SM</p>
        <p>Is something that happens in the open</p>
        <p>With everyone watching</p>
        <p>And talking</p>
        <p>Such pleasure;</p>
        <p>It feels almost sinful</p>
        <p>Relaxed by a suspension of air and oil</p>
        <p>Caressed by the sleek interior</p>
        <p>Seduced by the safe swiftness of the ride</p>
        <p>You never want to go home.''</p>
        <p>THE CRITICS SAID: With radical styling and unusual engineering, the SM was initially a hit with the press, and was Motor Trend's 1972 Car of the Year. But over time, the car's secret demons emerged. A former owner, Joe Molina, president of the JMPR public relations firm in Woodland Hills, Calif., summed up the SM this way: ''Powered by the Italians, produced by the French and engineered by Stephen King.''</p>
        <p>WHAT'S IT WORTH? Free is too much for a bad one. In October, an SM described by Norm Mort in Sports Car Market magazine as ''the worst car I've ever seen at any auction,'' went unsold in Toronto with a high bid of $4,900. A much nicer SM brought $24,800 in Raleigh, N.C., in December.</p>
