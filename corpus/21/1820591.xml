        <p>Re ''A Giant Receives a Second Chance, Twice,'' Jan. 6: The former Packer Grey Ruegamer, a backup offensive lineman for the Giants, still continues to give chances. On his way back from New York to California for the off-season, he and his wife, Lori, will be checking in at our school, Elmore Elementary in Green Bay, Wis., to see if students are still following criteria to become Ruegy Readers.</p>
        <p>Grey and Lori have donated several thousand dollars in books for the library in our school in a program that promotes participation, attendance, good behavior and reading. He began this program as a Packer and continued it this season.</p>

        <p>Elmore celebrates his second chances and the chances he continues to give. The N.F.L. needs players like Grey Ruegamer.</p>
