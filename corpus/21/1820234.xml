      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Felix Strobel, 24, a law student from Freiburg, Germany: ''My family and I started hiking the Alps maybe 10 years ago, and after a while it became a dream of ours to hike the highest mountain there, Mont Blanc. It took us two days, and on the first night I got elevation sickness. When we woke up at 3 the next morning and started to climb, I really wasn't in good condition. Each step was difficult; I felt powerless; I had a headache. But when I reached the top, the sickness and the pain were gone, and I was just happy my whole family had made it. It was a clear morning -- the sun had just risen a couple of minutes before. There were clouds beneath us, and you could see for hundreds of kilometers. Sometimes it was freezing on the way up, but when you're at the top, suddenly you stop freezing because you're so happy.''</p>
