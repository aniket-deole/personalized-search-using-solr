        <p>Aligot, a specialty of south-central France, is simply a purée of potatoes given supple elasticity and richness by the addition of cream, garlic and fresh Laguiole or Cantal cheese.</p>
        <p>The dish may be served alongside roasted or grilled meats. It is such a delectable tour de force, however, that at Michel Bras's restaurant in Laguiole, France, it is served as a separate course.</p>

        <p>Aligot, a specialty of south-central France, is simply a purée of potatoes given supple elasticity and richness by the addition of cream, garlic and fresh Laguiole or Cantal cheese.</p>
        <p>The dish may be served alongside roasted or grilled meats. It is such a delectable tour de force, however, that at Michel Bras's restaurant in Laguiole, France, it is served as a separate course.</p>
        <p>To make it yourself, finding the proper cheese and working the mixture to the desirable consistency are challenges.</p>
        <p>Now, Marie de Livinhac, a company in the Auvergne region, is making a dehydrated aligot mix that requires only crème fraîche, water and five minutes' time. Rubbing the pot with a garlic clove is optional.</p>
        <p>The secret is in sufficiently beating the mixture with a wooden spoon into satiny ribbons as it cooks.</p>
        <p>A package to make enough for two is $7.99, one for four to five servings is $11.99, both at Fairway.</p>
