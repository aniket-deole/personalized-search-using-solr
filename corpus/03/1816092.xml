        <p>Correction:  January 4, 2007, Thursday  An entry in the Transactions column in the Square Feet pages of Business Day yesterday about a recent lease at 111 John Street, Manhattan, carried incorrect information from a broker about the new tenant. It is Habitat for Humanity-New York City, not Habitat for Humanity International. The entry also listed the rent incorrectly. It is $25 per square foot, not $27.</p>
