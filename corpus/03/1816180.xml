        <p>A Bronx man has been indicted in connection with a fatal shooting in Mount Vernon that prosecutors say stemmed from a dispute over a building in the Bronx. The man, Michael J. Mitchell, 34, who was charged with second-degree murder, pleaded not guilty yesterday, prosecutors said. Mr. Mitchell is accused of shooting Glenn Brown through Mr. Brown's car window on the morning of April 14, said Janet DiFiore, the Westchester County district attorney. Prosecutors said that Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Brown were arguing about a building in the Bronx that they bought together in the early 1990s.</p>
