        <p>Making a further move into the market for cardiovascular drugs, the biotechnology giant Amgen has formed an alliance with Cytokinetics, a smaller company developing an experimental drug to treat heart failure.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, which is expected to be announced this morning, Amgen will pay Cytokinetics $75 million to gain an option on the drug, which is about to enter the second of three stages of clinical trials.</p>
        <p>Cytokinetics, which is based in South San Francisco, Calif., could eventually receive additional payments of more than $600 million, plus royalties, if the drug reaches the market and has significant sales.</p>
        <p>Amgen does not sell any drugs for heart diseases, but it is in late-stage trials of an anemia drug, Aranesp, as a treatment for heart failure.</p>
        <p>One uncertainty, however, is that a recent study in kidney disease patients showed overuse of drugs like Aranesp could actually cause heart problems.</p>
        <p>About five million Americans suffer from heart failure, in which the heart does not pump blood adequately. The disease is the leading cause of hospitalization among those over 65.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roger Perlmutter, executive vice president for research and development at Amgen, said his company had become intrigued with Cytokinetics' approach.</p>
        <p>''It's not been an area where there's been an enormous number of mechanistically new opportunities,'' Dr. Perlmutter said.</p>
        <p>The drug, called CK-1827452, activates cardiac myosin, a protein that plays a central role in making heart muscles contract to pump blood.</p>
        <p>The drug has not been tested in anyone with heart failure, only in healthy volunteers in Phase 1 studies designed primarily to test safety. But the president of Cytokinetics, Robert I. Blum, said the drug did increase heart-contracting ability in the volunteers and worked in dogs with heart failure.</p>
        <p>The agreement's terms reflect the uncertainty that the drug will get to market. Amgen's $75 million initial payment gives it only an option on the drug. After additional trials Amgen would have the right to take over development and commercialization of the drug for a payment of $50 million.</p>
        <p>The initial $75 million payment will consist of $42 million in cash and the purchase of $33 million in Cytokinetics stock, giving Amgen roughly 7 percent of the smaller company. Amgen will pay $9.47 a share, a 27 percent premium to Cytokinetics' closing price on Friday.</p>
