        <p>A man was fatally shot in Brooklyn late Friday while walking along a courtyard behind one of the buildings in the apartment complex where he lived, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The man, Odell Drayton, 23, was shot at least once in the back of the head about 10 p.m. at the rear of 675 Lincoln Avenue in the Lincoln Plaza complex in East New York, the police said. Seven .380-caliber shell casings were found at the scene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drayton lived with his grandmother and had an 18-month-old son who lives with Mr. Drayton's girlfriend at a public housing development nearby, neighbors said.</p>
        <p>Officers who responded to the shooting found Mr. Drayton sprawled on his back at the courtyard. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 10:15 p.m.</p>
        <p>The police said yesterday that they did not yet know the motive or have a description of the killer or killers. Mr. Drayton had an arrest record that included charges of assaulting a police officer, possession of marijuana, criminal contempt and disorderly conduct, according to the police. The dispositions of those cases were not immediately known.</p>
        <p>Neighbors set up a memorial where Mr. Drayton died, with candles and a teddy bear with the words, ''We Love You, O,'' on its chest.</p>
