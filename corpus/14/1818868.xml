        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your reporting in ''A Death in the Family'' (Dec. 24) makes clear that the traffic maneuver that killed Sara Robbins, the director of Brooklyn Law School's library, in Brooklyn Heights last month was a left turn by a private sanitation truck.</p>
        <p>So it's mystifying, and maddening, that for all the article's fussing over ''the intricate mechanics of the collision,'' it neglected to say that Ms. Robbins, who was proceeding straight and on foot, had the right of way over a turning truck.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, our study of New York City pedestrian fatalities, ''Killed by Automobile,'' established that the most lethal crash scenario is drivers turning into pedestrians in crosswalks, and that the most lethal vehicles, per mile driven, are private sanitation trucks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robbins's awful death, combined with that of Jessica Schmitz, who was killed two days later when a private sanitation truck turned into her path as she was lawfully crossing Park Avenue in Manhattan, suggests that nothing has changed.</p>
