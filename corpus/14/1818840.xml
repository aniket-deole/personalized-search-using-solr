        <p>Being a chief executive has many perks, but job security is not one of them, especially now. A record total of 1,478 chief executive departures were announced last year at United States-based companies, 12 percent more than in 2005.</p>
        <p>Health care companies had the highest turnover of chiefs, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the outplacement firm. Computer companies were second, and financial firms, affected by heavy merger activity last year, were third.</p>
        <p>It looks as if 2007 may be another banner year for departures. January started with a bang, as Home Depot's board forced out Robert L. Nardelli, the chief executive, over his pay and performance. His ejection (eased by a handsome exit package) was part of a growing demand for accountability at the top -- and fast.</p>
        <p>Being ousted is embarrassing, even if it comes with a golden handshake. That may be why some executives will soon, as ever, be resigning ''voluntarily'' to ''pursue other interests'' and ''spend more time with the family.''</p>
