        <p>Jeffrey Magee letter about Jan 7 article on craft of writing song lyrics</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Far from criticizing his lyrics for ''What's the Use of Wond'rin' '' in ''Carousel'' for the ''technical fault'' of ending on a hard consonant, Oscar Hammerstein II explained in his book ''Lyrics'' that he chose the word ''talk'' because that ''is exactly what I wanted the character to say.'' He then goes on for a full page to explain the choice. He does acknowledge that the word may have ''handicapped'' the song's popularity, but as he wrote in another song echoed in the article's headline, ''The words are true.''</p>
