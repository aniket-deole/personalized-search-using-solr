        <p>The stock market turned in its best performance in months last week, with all three major indexes posting substantial gains.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed on Friday at a record high, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index had its highest close since November 2000. For the Nasdaq composite index, Friday's close was the highest since February 2001.</p>
        <p>Strong earnings and economic reports buoyed the market. The Commerce Department said on Friday that retail sales climbed 0.9 percent in December. That was more than Wall Street had expected.</p>
        <p>Alcoa, the big aluminum maker, gained 7.1 percent for the week, the best performance among the Dow industrials. It said on Tuesday that its profit in the fourth quarter jumped 60 percent from the year-earlier period.</p>
        <p>For the week, the Dow rose 158.07 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 12,556.08. The S.&amp; P. 500 climbed 21.02 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 1,430.73. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 68.57 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 2,502.82.</p>
        <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond jumped to 4.77 percent from 4.64 percent the previous week.</p>
