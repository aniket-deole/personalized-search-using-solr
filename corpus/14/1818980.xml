        <p>A Colorado woman had too much snow and a Milford man had too little, so they went online and made a deal -- three snowballs for $39.89.</p>
        <p>The woman is Mary Walker, 51, a copywriter and former Monroe resident who went on eBay to auction some of the snow piling up outside her home in Loveland, Colo., after two early winter storms. The Milford man is Chris Hansen, 44, a Norwalk firefighter who promised his three daughters snow for Christmas.</p>
        <p>''It's not about buying snow,'' Mr. Hansen said. ''It's about laughter and humor.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Walker, whose auction was first reported in local newspapers in Colorado and Connecticut, said she initially offered the snow for sale as a joke, telling bidders she would use the proceeds to buy a snow blower.</p>
        <p>Soon, however, the tongue-in-cheek auction was getting real bids. Most of the winners backed out, but not Mr. Hansen. Facing one of the warmest winters on record, he wanted his snow delivered, cost be damned.</p>
        <p>So for about $100 for shipping, dry ice and a cooler, Mr. Hansen's snow should be on the way. ''We're going to do our darndest to get it there in shape,'' Ms. Walker said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hansen and Ms. Walker said they were regular eBay shoppers. Mr. Hansen once sold a thumbtack -- ''slightly used, like new condition,'' he said -- and Ms. Walker said she once sold a pair of quirky lamps to a man in Japan and made $1,100. But the snow sale is by far the strangest transaction they have been a part of.</p>
        <p>''I'm kind of worried now if I'm going to be able to go back,'' Ms. Walker said of her typical eBay sales. ''I'm not into chewed gum or things like that.''</p>
