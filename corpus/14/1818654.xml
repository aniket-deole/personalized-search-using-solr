        <p>Over the last nine years the annual JAPANESE CONTEMPORARY DANCE SHOWCASE has attracted a faithful following for its often weird and wonderful offerings. For its 10th anniversary the showcase has moved from the Japan Society to a more mainstream site, the Joyce Theater, with which it is presenting four companies. The names alone bode well: Noism 07, Pappa Tarahumara, Kim Itoh and the Glorious Future, and Leni-Basso. Tuesday through Jan. 21, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or joyce.org; $30, $23 for Joyce members.</p>
        <p>Not too far from the Joyce is the residence of the CEDAR LAKE ballet company, a worthy small-scale addition to the city's dance scene, since it specializes in new ballets, often by choreographers who are fairly well known in Europe but little seen in the United States. JACOPO GODANI, who danced with William Forsythe's Frankfurt Ballet for many years before establishing a successful choreographic career, falls into this category; it should be worth making the trip to the company's modern theater in the deepest reaches of Chelsea to see his ''SYMPTOMS OF DEVELOPMENT,'' created last year for the Nederlands Dans Theater and reworked for the Cedar Lake dancers. Also on the program are new works by Edgar Zendejas, the Mexican-born associate choreographer of Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal, and Benoit-Swan Pouffer, Cedar Lake's artistic director. Thursday through Jan. 22, 547 West 26th Street, (212) 868-4444 or cedarlakedance.com; $30, $20 for students and 65+.</p>
