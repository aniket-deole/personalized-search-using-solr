        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a longtime board member of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, I was distressed by the impression given in ''A One-Room Christmas,'' by Saki Knafo (Dec. 24).</p>
        <p>Having just volunteered there this Christmas, I can assure your readers that the residents of 211 East 81st Street are not alone -- on Christmas or any other day.</p>
        <p>They are, in fact, supported by friendly and caring staff and volunteers, much individual attention and a wide array of services, including counseling, job assistance, education, G.E.D. training and recreation.</p>
        <p>This Christmas many residents gathered for caroling, celebrating, opening presents and a bountiful dinner in a warm environment. One woman was especially pleased that she received the gift she hoped for -- membership in the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>She and her fellow residents are part of a caring community that helped them have a merry Christmas and enables them to lead more productive and fulfilling lives.</p>
