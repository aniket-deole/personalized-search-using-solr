        <p>The mithai, or Indian sweets, at Bengali Sweet House in Iselin are sublime in their simplicity. Although many of the classic sweets sold here are made from a short list of ingredients -- mainly milk -- the resulting variety of good things to taste is astounding.</p>
        <p>The sweets at Bengali Sweet House represent various regions of India, but to try some of the best, order those typical of Bengal, which is known for its confections. The mix includes cheeselike sandesh, rosogolla treats that ooze milk, and creamy white and pink cham-cham, shaped like cumulus clouds. The beautiful yellow hue of the aam sandesh signals its mango flavor. It tastes as good as it looks. All these sweets are $9 a pound.</p>

        <p>The mithai, or Indian sweets, at Bengali Sweet House in Iselin are sublime in their simplicity. Although many of the classic sweets sold here are made from a short list of ingredients -- mainly milk -- the resulting variety of good things to taste is astounding.</p>
        <p>The sweets at Bengali Sweet House represent various regions of India, but to try some of the best, order those typical of Bengal, which is known for its confections. The mix includes cheeselike sandesh, rosogolla treats that ooze milk, and creamy white and pink cham-cham, shaped like cumulus clouds. The beautiful yellow hue of the aam sandesh signals its mango flavor. It tastes as good as it looks. All these sweets are $9 a pound.</p>
        <p>Ghee, or clarified butter, and mawa, or dried condensed milk, are two essential ingredients in Indian sweets, and Bengali Sweet House makes both in house. The homemade quality is evident, especially in the gulab jaman, milk balls fried in ghee with cardamom, and in the fudgelike burfi (an assortment, $8 a pound). There are chocolate, coconut and pistachio burfi ($7 to $8 a pound). The dried fruit sweets, including the badam pista roll with almonds and pistachio, are also good ($9 a pound).</p>
        <p>Aside from sweets, Bengali Sweet House also sells a variety of chaat, or Indian snacks, including fresh fried samosas, filled with potatoes and peas (60 cents apiece). There is also a good selection of spiced cashews and peanuts.</p>
        <p>The Jain family, who hail from a long line of halwai, or sweet makers, in northern India, opened Bengali Sweet House in Iselin in 1998. A Jersey City location followed in 2002.</p>
        <p>Bengali Sweet House, 1384B Oak Tree Road, Iselin; (732) 404-1700; 836 Newark Avenue, Jersey City; (201) 798-9241;  www.bengalisweet.com.</p>
