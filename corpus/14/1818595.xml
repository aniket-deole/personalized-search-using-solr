An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger () indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders. Expanded rankings are available at The New York Times on the Web:nytimes.com/books. All four children's lists appear each week on the Book Review's Web site. Publishers have provided the age designations for their best-selling children's titles.</p>
