        <p>Today, an Iraqi judge officially dropped all remaining charges against Saddam Hussein. Well, that's nice. You don't want to leave a guy hanging.</p>
        <p>The prime minister of Iraq said that he would like to step down. I guess it didn't turn out to be the dream job that he thought it was going to be.</p>
        <p>Last week gas prices dropped 10 percent while the price of a gallon of gas rose 2 percent. How does that work? See, it's all supply and demand. The oil companies have the supply and they demand all our money.</p>

        <p>President Bush tonight announced that he is creating 20,000 new jobs. They are all in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has called for universal health care coverage for all Californians. He came up with this idea while breaking his leg falling down the ski slopes in Idaho.</p>

        <p>Today, New York City was blanketed with a bad odor, and officials aren't sure what caused it. Apparently, New Yorkers knew something was wrong because it smelled bad when they got out of their taxis.</p>
