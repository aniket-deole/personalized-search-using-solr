        <p>The nylon tote by Longchamp is known for transcending style tribes: you can see it slung low on a mom's shoulder, sunbathing with a coed or swinging down Houston Street on boys with black bangs.</p>
        <p>No wonder then that the latest Longchamp design -- a fitted trench coat in beige or black from the line's new ready-to-wear collection -- closes style gaps of its own. Made from French-milled cotton, the trench's deep jagged collar is dangerous enough for hipsters and sexy enough for grownups. Its no-fuss zippers soothe frenzied parents whose every car key and pacifier demands careful inventory.</p>

        <p>The nylon tote by Longchamp is known for transcending style tribes: you can see it slung low on a mom's shoulder, sunbathing with a coed or swinging down Houston Street on boys with black bangs.</p>
        <p>No wonder then that the latest Longchamp design -- a fitted trench coat in beige or black from the line's new ready-to-wear collection -- closes style gaps of its own. Made from French-milled cotton, the trench's deep jagged collar is dangerous enough for hipsters and sexy enough for grownups. Its no-fuss zippers soothe frenzied parents whose every car key and pacifier demands careful inventory.</p>
        <p>The trench was also built to travel: its fabric is blissfully wrinkle-free. The new collection is to arrive at Longchamp boutiques in early February, but the coat can be pre-ordered from the company's flagship store in SoHo ($1,155; 212-343-7444 to order).</p>
