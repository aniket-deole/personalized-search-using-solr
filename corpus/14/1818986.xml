        <p>Re ''Looks Like a Business; Should Be Taxed Like One,'' Jan. 7: A successful football coach will generate far more revenue for a university than what appears in the athletic budget.</p>
        <p>Alumni are proud of a winner and, consequently, can become motivated to make generous donations after their team has won a conference championship or a bowl game.

        <p>Re ''Looks Like a Business; Should Be Taxed Like One,'' Jan. 7: A successful football coach will generate far more revenue for a university than what appears in the athletic budget.</p>
        <p>Alumni are proud of a winner and, consequently, can become motivated to make generous donations after their team has won a conference championship or a bowl game. Corporations want to be associated with winners and are much more likely to sponsor an academic program within a university whose football team has been successful.</p>
        <p>As long as these are the facts, few universities will be willing to tolerate a losing coach, and many of them will offer outlandish salaries in an effort to hire one who will win.</p>
        <p>Jay Dunn  Hamilton Township, N.J.</p>
        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Money from boosters or the National Collegiate Athletic Association could be used for insurance policies for the players. If a player incurs a career-ending injury while serving a university, he could receive some kind of annuity that recognizes the sacrifice. Figuring this out should be relatively easy for the insurance folks.</p>
        <p>L. John Miller  Aurora, N.Y.</p>
        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>The market set Nick Saban's price, and the University of Alabama was willing to pay it. Most of his salary is not derived from taxpayer money. A top-quality coach brings added value to the university. One must consider not only direct athletic department revenues, but also ancillary benefits. For example, a winning team benefits the university's student recruitment efforts by providing a tremendous amount of national publicity.</p>
        <p>Players should receive some compensation (beyond a free college education) for their contributions. That's the only thing wrong with this picture. And the N.C.A.A. is to blame.</p>
