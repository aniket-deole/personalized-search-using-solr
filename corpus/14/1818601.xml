        <p>To most readers, Robert Pinsky is familiar as a former poet laureate of the United States, the author of an acclaimed translation of Dante's ''Inferno'' and the creator of the Favorite Poem Project, which invited ordinary people to submit poems with particular meaning to them, along with personal commentary. This week, in his review of Barbara Ehrenreich's ''Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy,'' Pinsky considers the cultural importance of Carnival, rock concerts and other celebratory mass events -- phenomena not as far from the world of poetry as it might seem. ''The emotional force of mass gatherings has profound importance,'' he explained in an e-mail message. ''I think we are desperate for something to counterbalance performances, great though they may be, that we experience electronically. We crave something else, something more personal as well as communal.'' The public readings sponsored by the Favorite Poem Project, he says, ''are among the most interesting group events I have witnessed: less performance than participation, and with a spirit hard to name, but unforgettable, and generated not just by each reader or poem, but by everyone there, together.'' His review begins on Page 10.</p>
