      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Brooklyn Heights Duplex  $785,000</p>
        <p>31 Pierrepont Street (near Willow Street), #1B/2B</p>
        <p>A two-bedroom, two-bath duplex, one of seven units in a 25-foot-wide brownstone. The apartment has high ceilings, two fireplaces, washer and dryer, and recently renovated baths. Donna Tirp (347) 834-6930, Thomas Murray (646) 404-7354, Prudential Douglas Elliman; www.elliman.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,325 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: Stylishly combined from two units, the apartment is larger than many brownstone co-ops, particularly in this central Heights location.</p>
        <p>CONS: The building does not allow dogs, and the galley kitchen could use an update.</p>
        <p>Montclair Tudor  $2,895,000</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY: 586 Park Street</p>
        <p>A new Tudor, built to look antique, with five bedrooms, six baths and four fireplaces. Set within a two-acre wooded preserve. Christine R. Lane, ReMax Village Square (973) 509-2222; www.remax-nj.com.</p>
        <p>TAXES: To be determined</p>
        <p>PROS: The setting is rare and lovely, the house beautifully designed.</p>
        <p>CONS: There is a cemetery within view, and taxes in the area are high and on the rise.</p>
        <p>Chelsea One-Bedroom  $729,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 360 West 28th Street (between Eighth and Ninth Avenues), #5B</p>
        <p>A one-bedroom, one-bath condo with a balcony in a building that is on the edge of the Penn South co-op complex. Michael Santo, Halstead Property (212) 381-6569; www.halstead.com</p>
        <p>COMMON CHARGE: $732 a month; taxes: $65 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: Instead of solid walls, the bedroom has sliding panels that open up the space and bring added light to the living area. The stainless steel kitchen has Miele and Sub-Zero appliances and a small washer/dryer.</p>
        <p>CONS: The living room overlooks a site that Penn South is converting into what it calls a ''junior'' basketball court.</p>
        <p>Upper East Side Two-Bedroom  $1,425,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 969 Park Avenue (at 82nd Street), #5E</p>
        <p>A two-bedroom, two-bath co-op in a prewar doorman building. Patricia Warburg Cliff, Corcoran Group (212) 836-1063; www.corcoran.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,403 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: This classic apartment oozes prewar charm, with high ceilings, hardwood floors, crown moldings and a decorative marble fireplace. The master bedroom is spacious and comes with his and hers dressing areas. The second bedroom is being used as a study and is lined with built-in bookshelves.</p>
        <p>CONS: The apartment faces an interior courtyard and has no views.</p>
        <p>Hudson River Multifamily  $1,595,000</p>
        <p>WESTCHESTER: 1178 Warburton Avenue, Yonkers</p>
        <p>A 114-year-old Victorian with five apartments: the largest has two bedrooms, one bath and three fireplaces; two have one bedroom and one bath; one has three bedrooms and a bath; and one is a studio. Jane McAfee, Houlihan Lawrence (914) 337-0400; www.houlihanlawrence.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $22,100 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: The largest apartment has oak floors and a renovated kitchen with trendy appliances. The house is perched high on a hill, affording grand views of the Hudson. The zoning for the 0.67-acre-lot allows for redevelopment to a condo complex.</p>
        <p>CONS: The house is on a busy commercial street and requires a steep climb to the front door. And the Yonkers public school system has been troubled for decades.</p>
