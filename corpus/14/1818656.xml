        <p>In 2006 the Las Vegas band PANIC! AT THE DISCO emerged as a million-selling juggernaut (no mean feat in this slow market), and MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE, from New Jersey, released a glorious epic, ''The Black Parade'' (although that album has yet to reach one million in American sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan). Both bands emerged from the country's still-fertile emo scene, though none of their members seem eager to be associated with it. (Would you be?) And their success is proof that the emo era isn't over yet.</p>
        <p>So here comes FALL OUT BOY, the Illinois group that is arguably the country's most popular emo act -- or at any rate was, way back in 2005. That was the year Fall Out Boy released ''From Under the Cork Tree'' (Island), which sold more than 2.5 million copies in the United States and helped prove that self-aware pop-punk songs with long titles (one was called ''A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More 'Touch Me' '') could become rock radio staples.</p>
        <p>The new Fall Out Boy album, ''Infinity on High'' (Island), is due in shops on Feb. 6, and the first single, ''This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race,'' can already be heard, and seen, on MTV (and of course YouTube). It begins with a snippet of ''Dance, Dance,'' from the last album, and then follows the band members into what looks like a hip-hop studio: the room is full of skeptical African-Americans, and the song starts with an electronic beat. By video's end, everything is back to normal: the fizzy punk chorus has arrived, and the guys are piling into the sort of beat-up tour van they outgrew years ago. See them in their element on Tuesday at the Hammerstein Ballroom. Also on the bill: New Found Glory, Lifetime and Permanent Me. 6:15 p.m., 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $35.</p>
