        <p>There is no doubt about who commands the microphone in the boardroom of Emmis Communications.</p>
        <p>An investor was asking his fellow shareholders to vote to eliminate Emmis's Class B shares, which carry 10 votes each and give Jeffrey H. Smulyan, the founder, chairman and chief executive, control of the company though he owns less than 20 percent of its stock.</p>
        <p>Emmis's board did not support or oppose the proposal. It just declined to even consider it at all. The board said the issue was ''moot'' because the change required the cooperation of Mr. Smulyan, and he had already said he'd withhold it.</p>
