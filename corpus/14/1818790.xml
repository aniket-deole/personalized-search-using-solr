        <p>Pack rats who find themselves unable to edit the contents of their evening clutches to the bare necessities -- lipstick and cellphone, credit card and keys -- will appreciate the sleek but roomy Foldover bag by Poppie Couture. The line, which came out three months ago, is fast becoming a favorite of trendy West Coast women and celebrities like Jessica Simpson, Naomi Watts and Jennifer Aniston, who scooped up a bunch as Christmas gifts for her girlfriends.</p>
        <p>Poppie Harris, the line's creator, said: ''I wanted a bag that could do different things. You can fold it, scrunch it, pack it flat for travel.''</p>
        <p>The bags, which start at $300, come in colors like ruby red, white lotus, latte and gold. Styles include fake crocodile, snakeskin and simple leather, and the bags can also be made to order at www.poppiecouture.com.</p>
