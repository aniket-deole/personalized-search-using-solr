      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am grateful for Damon Linker's generous and generally accurate review of my ''What Paul Meant'' (Dec. 31).But he has no grounds for saying that I ''reject ... the early church councils, the church fathers and even, in many instances, the Gospels themselves.'' I invoked the early creeds and councils as a basis for my faith in ''Why I Am a Catholic,'' have written often of the church father Augustine, and am now composing a book on the authenticity of the four Gospels, a point that was implicit in my ''What Jesus Meant'' but whose reasons I am now explicitly expounding.</p>
