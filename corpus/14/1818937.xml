        <p>Two police officers have been suspended without pay for failing to adequately investigate a 15-year-old girl's complaint that a man had tried to kidnap her, the police said yesterday. The man, a paroled sex offender, is now suspected of abducting and raping a 17-year-old girl just two hours after the complaint, the police said.</p>
        <p>The officers, who have not been identified by the police, are assigned to the 101st Precinct in Queens, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Eric McCoy, was arrested on Jan. 3 and has been charged with committing two rapes in Queens in a little more than four weeks. In each case, he posed as a police officer and raped his victims inside motel rooms, the police said.</p>
        <p>In the first assault, which occurred on Dec. 4, Mr. McCoy abducted a woman, 27, as she was getting off a bus in Jamaica and forced her to a motel, the police said. In the second episode, the authorities said, Mr. McCoy approached a 17-year-old girl on Jan. 2 in Kew Gardens and identified himself as a ''police special investigator.'' He said he had a gun and took her to a motel where he raped her, the police said.</p>
        <p>Hours before the second rape, Mr. McCoy had told a 15-year-old girl that he was a police officer investigating an assault. After showing her a fake badge, he told her to wait inside a laundry. Inside, she talked about the encounter with a woman, who called 911, the police said.</p>
        <p>Once the police arrived, Mr. McCoy approached the squad car and told the officers that two girls had been in a fight. When the girl came to the car, they asked whether she had been fighting. They told her to get into the car, drove her to a subway station and told her to go to school, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The officers failed to check whether Mr. McCoy had a criminal record and, apparently, to question others at the scene, the police said. Mr. McCoy was arrested after one victim remembered that he had identified himself as ''Investigator McCoy.''</p>
