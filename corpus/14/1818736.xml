        <p>Editorial calls on Connecticut to end Sunday closing law, which forces people to scramble to out-of-state stores to buy liquor</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Many Connecticut residents experienced the annoying necessity this past Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve of having to act like bootleggers in order to serve alcohol at parties. Those who had not planned ahead were forced to drive to border states to purchase wine, beer and other spirits. The reason? This year, both days, normally among the strongest for liquor sales, fell on Sundays, when it is illegal to sell alcohol in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>There are many worse fates, of course, but the tyranny of the calendar combined with the state's enduring Sunday closing law forced people to scramble to out-of-state stores. Connecticut clings to the Puritan tradition of a Sunday ban, in part because many mom-and-pop establishments, which like to stay closed on Sunday, have fought to keep it.</p>

        <p>Many Connecticut residents experienced the annoying necessity this past Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve of having to act like bootleggers in order to serve alcohol at parties. Those who had not planned ahead were forced to drive to border states to purchase wine, beer and other spirits. The reason? This year, both days, normally among the strongest for liquor sales, fell on Sundays, when it is illegal to sell alcohol in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>There are many worse fates, of course, but the tyranny of the calendar combined with the state's enduring Sunday closing law forced people to scramble to out-of-state stores. Connecticut clings to the Puritan tradition of a Sunday ban, in part because many mom-and-pop establishments, which like to stay closed on Sunday, have fought to keep it.</p>
        <p>But in the past few years alone a dozen states have done away with the Sunday booze ban. Even Massachusetts, which started the practice nearly 400 years ago, has ditched the tradition. States like Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York, which border Connecticut, are now cashing in on the Nutmeg State's stubborn attachment to an inconvenient and inessential law.</p>
        <p>One consolation is that this year, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve are on Mondays, and they will not fall again on Sundays until 2017, by which time the legislature may have come to its senses.</p>
