        <p>The twin Californian obsessions of property and personal maintenance receive renewed anthropological attention in the second season of ''THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ORANGE COUNTY,'' which begins Tuesday at 10 p.m. on Bravo. Truer to documentary style than reality-TV form, the show continues to follow the lives of the same group of women it began examining last year: working mothers and their stay-at-home counterparts, carousing and laboring to self-actualize in one of the fabled gated communities of suburban Southern California. This season we get to see Jo, the only unmarried woman in the group, back together with her boyfriend, a status that does not seem to impede her from going to a party at the Playboy Mansion. Husbands receive increased attention this season, as do the children, layabout teenagers and 20-somethings who seem to confirm the assumption that extreme privilege robs young souls.</p>
        <p>No relationship is what it seems in the movies that make up BBC America's ''Crimes of Passion'' series, part of its excellent Mystery Monday package. ''SOUNDPROOF,'' which will be broadcast on Monday at 9 p.m., is the third installment of the ''Crimes of Passion'' films. A young deaf man is thought to have killed his roommate, and the sign-language expert helping investigators on the case falls for him. Do the complications mount from there? Yes, they do.</p>
