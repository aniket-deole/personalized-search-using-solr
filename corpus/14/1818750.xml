        <p>With Christopher J. Dodd officially running for president, a Connecticut senator will be part of presidential politics for the third election cycle in a row.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodd is calling himself the ''dark horse'' in a crowded race in which candidates, and would-be candidates, have been jockeying for early attention. Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois have dominated the spotlight so far, even though they have not officially declared their intentions.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Dodd made somewhat of an odd pick by announcing the start of his campaign on Don Imus's nationally syndicated radio show early Thursday, the morning after President Bush's speech on Iraq.</p>
        <p>''I'm not as well known as some of the other candidates who'll be running, but a year from now, we'll still be talking about the first caucuses and primaries,'' he said. ''Twelve months is more than a lifetime in politics.''</p>
        <p>Senator Dodd, 62, said he had finally decided that he wanted to get ''out of the bleachers and on the arena floor and make my case.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodd, in his fifth term, said he planned to have a rally with Connecticut supporters this week, after traveling to Iowa and South Carolina to gather early support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Imus needled Mr. Dodd by saying that he had been particularly impressed with Mr. Obama.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodd responded with a mix of chuckles and indignation: ''Wait a minute. I come on the program, I blow everyone else off. I announce here -- at least leave the door open a little bit for me.''</p>
        <p>The state's other senator, Joseph I. Lieberman, ran for vice president in 2000 and president in 2004.</p>
