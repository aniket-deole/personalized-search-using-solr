      <abstract>
        <p>Correction on January 7 article about online diamond company Blue Nile; company ranks behind Tiffany &amp; Company as well as at least one other competitor, Signet Group; Mondera.com is still in business (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article last Sunday about Blue Nile, an online diamond jewelry company, referred incorrectly to its relative standing among companies that sell the most diamond rings in the United States each year. Although jewelers do not provide comparable statistics about diamond-ring sales, Blue Nile does indeed rank behind Tiffany &amp; Company. It also ranks behind at least one other competitor, the Signet Group, which operates Kay Jewelers.</p>
        <p>The article also referred incorrectly to Mondera.com, another online jeweler. It is still in business; it is not defunct. And the article misspelled the city where the Zale Corporation, the jewelry retailer, has its headquarters. It is Irving, Tex., not Irvine.</p>
