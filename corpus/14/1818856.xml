        <p>If Zach Nelson, the chief executive of NetSuite, hopes to be paid like a pro athlete, his company may have chosen the wrong baseball executive.</p>
        <p>NetSuite, a small-business-software maker backed by Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle, added Billy Beane, the former big-league baseball player who is now general manager of the Oakland Athletics, to its board this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beane has signed multimillion-dollar contracts with some pitchers and shortstops, to be sure. But he is best known for his strategy of playing hardball in salary negotiations and squeezing the most out of players for the least money, which was the subject of ''Moneyball,'' a best-selling book by Michael Lewis.</p>
