        <p>With three open spots in their starting rotation and no top-flight pitchers left on the free-agent market, the Mets have turned toward a lower-tier starter.</p>
        <p>The Mets are close to signing Jorge Sosa to a one-year contract, said a baseball official with direct knowledge of the deal. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal was not complete.</p>
        <p>Sosa had his best season in 2005, going 13-3 with a 2.55 earned run average, but he struggled last season with the Atlanta Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals, going 3-11 with a 5.42 E.R.A. In five major league seasons, Sosa, 29, has a 27-40 record with a 4.61 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>General Manager Omar Minaya and Manager Willie Randolph made it clear last week at the Mets' minicamp in Port St. Lucie, Fla., that the only two guaranteed spots in the Mets' rotation belonged to Tom Glavine and Orlando Hern√°ndez.</p>
