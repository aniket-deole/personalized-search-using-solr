        <p>Sometimes Simon's Marketplace in Chester seems like the center of the local universe, it's so full of people shopping for specialty foods, buying takeout items and noshing. Although the general store's space is ample, there are just 24 seats for eating-in. They are often full, with people munching savory or sweet crepes, house-made scones, sandwiches and other goodies made by four full-time chefs.</p>
        <p>Available daily are four savory buckwheat crepes (a popular favorite is the wild mushroom with blue cheese) and six sweet ones (with banana-and-chocolate a crowd-pleaser). The fresh-made scones are another big hit, with different ones offered each day (try the peach-and-ginger or maple walnut if they're on the menu).</p>

        <p>Sometimes Simon's Marketplace in Chester seems like the center of the local universe, it's so full of people shopping for specialty foods, buying takeout items and noshing. Although the general store's space is ample, there are just 24 seats for eating-in. They are often full, with people munching savory or sweet crepes, house-made scones, sandwiches and other goodies made by four full-time chefs.</p>
        <p>Available daily are four savory buckwheat crepes (a popular favorite is the wild mushroom with blue cheese) and six sweet ones (with banana-and-chocolate a crowd-pleaser). The fresh-made scones are another big hit, with different ones offered each day (try the peach-and-ginger or maple walnut if they're on the menu).</p>
        <p>Among many popular sandwiches are the Southwest (turkey, bacon, avocado, Cheddar and chipotle mayonnaise on a ciabatta roll), ham and Brie (with green apples, honey mustard and tomato on multigrain bread) and the Mekong sub (pickled daikon radish, cucumber, fresh cilantro and five-spice sausage on a baguette). Simon's baguettes, made with butter and Portuguese sea salt, are another reason to make this a stop.</p>
        <p>Owned for the last two and a half years by Jim and Jody Reilly, Simon's also produces many delicious dishes to go, including shepherd's pie, sausage-and-lentil stew and stuffed eggplant. There is also a good imported cheese selection, along with a variety of coffee drinks -- cappuccino, latte and the like, as well as Jim's Organic Coffees available in bulk.</p>
        <p>This friendly, all-purpose food store is open Monday through Saturday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>Simon's Marketplace, 17 Main Street, Chester; (860) 526-8984.</p>
