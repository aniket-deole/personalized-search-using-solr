        <p>DEUTSCH--Charlotte, 93, of Boynton Beach, FL, formerly of Roslyn Harbor and Great Neck, NY, died peacefully last week surrounded by loving family members. Charlotte was devoted to her cherished late husband, Jack; her beloved daughters, Abby Fink and Janet Zilin; her adored grandchildren of whom she was so proud, Juliet, Robin, Dara and Gregory; and her nieces and nephews who lent joy to her life. Charlotte was a strong woman of many interests and talents, a wise and tireless conversationalist, a consummate hostess, a marvelous baker and chef, a gifted artist, and a trophy-winning golfer. Charlotte lived a full and exciting life, and will be deeply missed by all those whose lives she touched. Shiva was observed in FL and will be concluded at Abby's home, today from 3pm to 8pm.</p>
