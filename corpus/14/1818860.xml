        <p>Federal prosecutors successfully concluded criminal cases against two former U.S. Foodservice executives late last year, but the affair is not over.</p>
        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said Suzanne Brown, the former corporate controller, agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty to resolve accusations that she helped inflate revenue by $700 million from 2000 to 2003. She did not admit or deny any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Resnick, the company's ex-finance chief, pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges last September and was sentenced in December to six months' home detention and three years' probation. Mark P. Kaiser, a former marketing executive, was convicted in federal court in Manhattan in November; he is to be sentenced Feb. 8.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. is still investigating the case, an agency official said, and more enforcement actions may come soon.</p>
