      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>David Wright, the Mets' All-Star third baseman, signed a six-year, $55 million contract extension last August with a team option for 2013. Given that security and newfound wealth, Wright, a bachelor, recently put down roots in Manhattan. He bought a 4,000-square-foot penthouse loft in the Flatiron district that had been listed for $6.5 million.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT</p>
        <p>FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK? -- I have two. I love Smith &amp; Wollensky and I love Tao.</p>
        <p>HAVE YOU BEEN OUT WITH DEREK JETER? -- No. During the off-season, he doesn't spend too much time in New York, and in the season we have opposite schedules.</p>
        <p>WHAT DO YOU DO LIKE TO DO WHEN NOT PLAYING BASEBALL? -- I am just a normal 24-year-old. I love playing video games. I have a PlayStation 3. I love ''Madden,'' college football and ''Fight Night.'' A lot of times, that is what I do to wind down after games: I'll just go home and play video games for an hour and try to relax.</p>
        <p>READING ANYTHING? -- I graduated high school in 2001, and it's been six years. I was pretty intelligent in high school and I feel like I may be losing it, so I have tried picking up a crossword puzzle or a sudoku. But as far as reading goes, I just read magazines. I am a pretty impatient person.</p>
        <p>FAVORITE SUBJECT IN SCHOOL? -- I loved anatomy and physiology in high school.</p>
        <p>WHAT HAVE YOU WORKED ON IMPROVING? -- I have been in the weight room a lot, but I am the same size I was. I have stressed speed and agility and getting a quicker first step. Over the last three years, my body has naturally worn down a little over a 162-game season and you try to limit that and recover quicker.</p>
