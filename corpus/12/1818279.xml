        <p>Opens today nationwide  Directed by Sylvain White  109 minutes</p>
        <p>Brotherhood is powerful. That's the message of ''Stomp the Yard,'' a strange and at times strangely compelling mix of black fraternity recruitment video and inspirational tale about a hip-hop boy in a stepping world.</p>
        <p>After a dance-off ends with a fight and murder, DJ leaves Los Angeles and krumping for Atlanta and stepping. At Truth University (go, Truth!), the all-black school where he enrolls, stepping -- that combination of precision dancing, marching and chanting done in African-American fraternities and sororities -- rules, and Gammas and Thetas are the Sharks and Jets.</p>
        <p>DJ (the engaging Columbus Short) stands out: he's a work-study student among the haute bourgeoisie and a street-style dancer among steppers (though it can be difficult to differentiate styles in the frenetically edited dance sequences). ''Stomp the Yard'' means to be a fable about finding your place in the group (a primal college story, after all) and succeeds most when it hews closest to genre formulas, showing a milieu rarely glimpsed on film, and least when it too warmly embraces fraternity culture.</p>
        <p>Here, frat affiliation is lifelong and a predictor of success, with a pedigree so echt it includes the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But race and social justice are incidental to the Gammas and Thetas and to ''Stomp,'' which posits a world in which white people exist only to fill seats in upscale restaurants. DJ doesn't need to change the world, he just needs to find a way to dance in it.</p>
        <p>RACHEL SALTZ</p>
        <p>''Stomp the Yard'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is a little violence, a little sex and a lot of stepping.</p>
