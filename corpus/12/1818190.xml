        <p>To the Editor: If you lack time for the atomic tourism described in ''Strange Love'' (Jan. 5), you can use Google to see satellite photos of decommissioned B-52s at the Boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson. Like Roman ruins, the once formidable planes are a shell of their former selves, their sawed-off fuselages lying sadly in the dust. What used to be terrifying has somehow become poignant, as if a great epoch had ended. I suppose we can find cathartic relief in the mummification of a Titan II missile, but this may be cold comfort. The United States has spent more than $5 trillion on nuclear weapons since 1940, and judging from the current administration's Nuclear Posture Review, which was made public in 2002 and calls for a complete revitalization of the country's nuclear infrastructure, this spending is far from done. Don't be fooled by moth balls. Old nukes are like old rock stars -- they never go away.</p>
