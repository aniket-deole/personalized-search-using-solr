        <p>The Westin St. Maarten Dawn Beach Residences</p>
        <p>WHAT -- Residences at a Caribbean resort.  WHERE -- St. Maarten.  AMENITIES -- A casino and a full-service spa, among others.  PRICES -- Units from $1.2 million to $2 million.  STATUS -- The resort opened last month. The first residences should be completed in March and the rest in June.  DEVELOPER -- Columbia Sussex.  CONTACT -- (866) 978-0800 or www.westinstmaartenresidences.com.  DETAILS -- On the east coast of the Netherlands-governed section of St. Maarten, this project consists of 99 condominiums spread over four three-story buildings adjoining a new 317-room resort. The units, each 1,654 square feet with three bedrooms, are sold in full ownership. Units that meet various requirements -- bedding and bathroom details, among others -- may be placed in a revenue-sharing rental program when the owners are away. Some units will come with such details; others may be upgraded. Fronting a mile-long beach, the development includes a large infinity-edge pool, lounges and a fitness center, as well as retail shops and restaurants. The on-site casino has 260 slot machines and 10 gaming tables.</p>
        <p>Star Tower</p>
        <p>WHAT -- Residential tower in a resort area.  WHERE -- Orlando, Fla.  AMENITIES -- A rooftop area with a pool and a fitness center, among others.  PRICES -- Residences range from $500,000 to $2 million.  STATUS -- Scheduled for completion in August.  DEVELOPER -- Historic Creations.  CONTACT -- (407) 422-4664 or www.historiccreations.com.  DETAILS -- This project, an 18-story tower with 100 condominiums, is in downtown Orlando near Lake Eola Park and a short drive from the area's many theme parks. Its one- to two-bedroom, 1,150- to 3,600-square-foot units are offered in five floor plans, including six two-story units and four penthouses. All the units, which will be sold in whole ownership, will have terraces. The rooftop area, which will be surrounded by cabanas, will have a lounge, a whirlpool and telescopes in addition to the pool and fitness center. A restaurant planned for the ground floor will offer room service.</p>
