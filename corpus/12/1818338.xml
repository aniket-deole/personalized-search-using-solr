        <p>The General Prosecutor's Office announced the arrest of what it called the organizer of the killing of Andrei A. Kozlov, the first deputy chairman of Russia's central bank, in September. The office declined to identify the suspect, but the man's lawyer told Russian news agencies that he was Andrei Y. Frenkel, the director of two banks that Mr. Kozlov shut down last year over accusations of money laundering and other irregularities. Mr. Kozlov's killing, which came a month before the killing of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, raised alarms about the safety of prominent reformers. Arrests have been rare in contract-style murders.</p>
