        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday that Coney Island Commons had been selected to develop a community center and moderate-cost housing near Surf Avenue in Coney Island. The project, expected to start in the fall of 2008 and finish the following summer, involves the construction of 152 housing units in two buildings between West 29th and West 30th Streets, of which 75 percent will be for low- and moderate-income people. The $56 million development is also expected to provide a 40,000-square-foot community center that will be operated by the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York.</p>
