      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The family of a 45-year-old man who was fatally shot last year by a New Jersey Park Police officer filed a wrongful-death suit yesterday in State Superior Court. The suit names the officer and several colleagues, the State of New Jersey and the Park Police. The man, Emil Mann, a member of the Ramapough Mountain Indians, had been at a barbecue in the woods of Mahwah on April 1 when the officer, Chad Walder, shot him twice without justification, the suit alleges. Officer Walder, who has said he fired in self-defense, and two other officers also delayed getting medical help to Mr. Mann, the suit says. A lawyer for Officer Walder, Robert Galantucci, said the shooting was justified. No criminal charges have been filed in the case, and the Bergen County prosecutor's office has said the investigation is still open. Mr. Mann, who grew up on the mountain where he was shot, lived in Monroe, N.Y., and had three children.</p>
