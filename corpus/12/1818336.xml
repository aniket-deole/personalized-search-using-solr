        <p>The leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico have asked the Vatican to defrock the Rev. Nicolás Aguilar, a priest with a long history of sex-abuse allegations who has evaded prosecution for nearly two decades. Cardinal Norberto Rivera, the archbishop of Mexico, along with two other high-ranking bishops, sent the request in late December to a special ecclesiastical committee in the Vatican charged with investigating sexual abuse by priests. The decision came after new reports about Father Aguilar's case. Although wanted in Los Angeles since 1989 on 19 counts of sexually molesting children, he continued to work as a priest in Mexico. He has been accused of similar crimes in Mexico in the 1990s, including the brutal rape of an alter boy in 1994.</p>
