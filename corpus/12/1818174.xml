        <p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, made a famous declaration after his obituary was published in 1897. ''The report of my death was an exaggeration,'' Twain said, and he went right on living for nearly 13 years. The spirit of his wit and cynicism is the basis for ''Twainathon,'' a two-week festival of plays, musicals and solo pieces -- all inspired by the work of this writer, humorist and lecturer -- at the Metropolitan Playhouse in the East Village. The playhouse, which ran a well-attended ''Poefest'' last year, specializes in new and revitalized productions focusing on American literature and the American theater. Twain certainly seems like a good subject. His writings -- from the well-known tales of life along the Mississippi River to lesser-known works like the social commentary ''The Mysterious Stranger,'' published posthumously in 1916 -- are quintessentially American. ''Twainathon'' is divided into seven different evenings, called Riverboats A through G. The performances include a new, full-length adaptation of ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''; dramatizations of some of Twain's short stories, like ''Excerpts From Adam's Diary''; and a musical based on ''The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg.'' One work, ''The Report of My Death,'' is drawn from letters and lesser-known writings and is intended to show what its creator, Adam Klasfeld, calls the ''darker and more political'' aspects of Twain. Some of Twain's later writings were quite radical, Mr. Klasfeld said. (Certain works, like the antiwar article ''The War Prayer,'' were initially rejected by publishers.) In this solo show, Ron Crawford, above, is Samuel Clemens, back from the dead and able to say whatever he wants. (Monday through Jan. 28 at the Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village 212-995-5302, metropolitanplayhouse.org; $18; $15 for students and 65+; $10 for children under 12.)</p>
