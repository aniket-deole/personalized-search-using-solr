        <p>A powerful explosion, reportedly caused by a rocket, rocked the American Embassy in Athens Friday morning.</p>
        <p>Reuters, quoting the police and embassy officials, said that a rocket had been fired at the complex but that no one was hurt. The private-television station MEGA also reported that the cause was a rocket.</p>
        <p>''This was a rocket attack launched from a building across the street,'' a senior police official told Reuters. ''It landed inside a toilet on the third floor of the embassy.''</p>
        <p>Greek anti-terrorist officers were on the scene.</p>
        <p>''This is an act of terrorism. We don't know where from,'' said the Attica police chief, Asimakis Golfis. ''There was a shell that exploded in the toilets of the building.'' He said it had been fired from street level.</p>
        <p>The police cordoned off the block and were searching nearby apartment buildings and a hospital.</p>
        <p>The police said the explosion occurred at 5:55 a.m., but they released little other information.</p>
        <p>Early accounts from witnesses indicated that it had occurred at the embassy's front entrance, near the eagle emblem, Agence France-Presse said. Greek news media reported that a window near the emblem has been smashed, but there was no indication of further damage.</p>
        <p>''The explosion sounded in the courtyard, then a fire broke out over the central entrance, where the emblem is situated,'' a Greek motorist told private Skai radio.</p>
