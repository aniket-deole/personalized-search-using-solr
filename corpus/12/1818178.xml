        <p>Comic books have inspired films, television series and even novels. Now they have begun to invade a new realm: the live talk show. ''Comic Book Club'' -- something of a mix between a comic-book convention and a night of improv -- features interviews with comics-industry insiders, like writers and artists; a segment called ''The Week in Geek'' that reviews comics news; and a musical performance that may or may not be related to superheroes. (One past song touched on video games.) But the show is not just a dry run-down. Moderated by its founder, Alexander Zalben, above right, the artistic director of the People's Improv Theater; Justin Tyler, above center, an actor and writer; and Pete LePage, above left, a stand-up comedian, ''Comic Book Club'' recently held a raucous debate on an age-old question: Could Bucky, Captain America's trusted sidekick, win a fight with Robin, of Batman and Robin fame? The show's moderators joined forces after Mr. Zalben saw Mr. LePage with a bag from a comics store last fall and hesitantly unmasked himself as a fellow fan. Mr. Zalben recruited Mr. LePage and Mr. Tyler to do the show, figuring it out as they went along. ''Not the most amazing origin story -- we were bitten by a radioactive talk show? -- but there it is,'' Mr. Zalben said. Amazing beginning or not, the audiences of comic-book aficionados, which have been growing each week since the show had its premiere in December, seem pleased. They laugh in the right places and compete in the trivia contest for a $25 gift certificate to Midtown Comics, a show sponsor. (Tuesday nights at 9:30, the Pit, 154 West 29th Street, Chelsea, brownpapertickets.com, 800-838-3006; $5.)</p>
