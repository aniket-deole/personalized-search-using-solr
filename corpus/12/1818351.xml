        <p>A dance entry in the Listings pages of Weekend last Friday about Complexions Contemporary Ballet, which is at the Joyce Theater this week, misstated the date its engagement ends. It is Sunday; it did not end yesterday.</p>
        <p>The entry also misidentified the choreographer whose work is set to the music of Marvin Gaye. He is Dwight Rhoden -- not Desmond Richardson, who is a choreographer and dancer who runs the company with Mr. Rhoden. And the entry included an outdated reference to a new work by Nicolo Fonte. The program was changed and does not include that work.</p>
