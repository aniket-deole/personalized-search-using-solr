        <p>In its 99 years, the Millrose Games has never staged a women's race longer than a mile. Meet officials said yesterday there would be a women's 3,000-meter race -- almost two miles -- in this year's meet, Feb. 2 at Madison Square Garden, and the field would be led by the world's best women's distance runner.</p>
        <p>She is 21-year-old Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia, the first runner, male or female, to hold the world championships at 5,000 and 10,000 meters outdoors. She has also won three world championships in cross-country. Her opposition will include Jen Rhines, an American Olympian in 2004 and the national champion at 10,000 meters outdoors in 2005, and Sarah Hall, 12th for the United States in last year's world indoor championships.</p>
