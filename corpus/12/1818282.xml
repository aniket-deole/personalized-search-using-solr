        <p>''Abduction: The Megumi Yokota Story'' is an engrossing nonfiction detective tale about the 13-year-old girl of the title, who vanished on the way home from school in Niigata, Japan, in 1977. But it also succeeds as a thumbnail review of a painful chapter of Asian history, and as a portrait of lives transformed by trauma.</p>
        <p>Megumi was one of 13 Japanese citizens North Korea has admitted kidnapping as part of a program to teach spies-in-training how to pass for Japanese. As the Japanese government's investigation of the abductions dragged on through the 1990s, it affected efforts to normalize Japanese-North Korean relations and turned the abductees' families into media figures and political players.</p>
        <p>Had the directors Patty Kim and Chris Sheridan stopped there, ''Abduction'' would have amounted to a politically tinged domestic nightmare told in Court TV language (ominous synthesizer music, creepy re-enactments) with some showily ''Eastern'' flourishes (including cutaways to trees, grass and foamy tide, and narrative ellipses that seem intended as meditative but which play like arty fat).</p>
        <p>The filmmakers have loftier goals, though, and in the end their existential tabloid style justifies itself. ''Abduction'' isn't about what happened, but about the painful introspection that is sparked by not knowing. It's about how Megumi's disappearance shattered her parents and siblings, and how they channeled their grief and changed their lives.</p>
