        <p>U.S. Preparing for Trials of Top Qaeda Detainees  The Bush administration has set up a secret war room in a Virginia suburb where it is assembling evidence to prosecute high-ranking detainees from Al Qaeda, including the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, officials have said. The effort is the first concrete steps taken to advance war crimes trials under a plan announced by President Bush last September.</p>

        <p>Democrats Choose Denver  The Democrats chose Denver over New York as the site for their 2008 national convention, capping months of debate about which city had better logistics, deeper pockets and a more compelling backdrop to frame the party's message.</p>

        <p>Stem Cell Bill Clears House  The House voted overwhelmingly to broaden federal support for embryonic stem cell research, stepping up a confrontation with President Bush over an issue that Democrats hope to capitalize on in the next election. The White House said the president would veto the bill.</p>

        <p>I.R.S.
