        <p>Two new ABC comedies failed to gain traction Wednesday, one week after making their debuts to modest ratings. Pushed back because of the live presidential address at 9 p.m., ''Knights of Prosperity'' drew 5.2 million viewers at about 9:30, according to Nielsen's estimates, while ''In Case of Emergency'' reached 5.8 million at 10. ABC did lead the 8 p.m. hour in total viewers with two episodes of ''According to Jim'' at 8 (8.3 million) and 8:30 (8.8 million). ABC finished third for the night. Among adults 18 to 49, CBS's premiere of ''Armed and Dangerous'' (8.2 million) won the 8 p.m. hour, while reruns of ''Criminal Minds'' from 9:30 to 10:30 (11.4 million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10:30 (10.1 million) put CBS on top for the night over all. NBC ranked second for the night, as an abbreviated ''Deal or No Deal'' (11.3 million) following President Bush's speech was the night's highest rated show among adults 18 to 49. (Nielsen estimated that 42.5 million viewers tuned in for the president's speech.) On the CW, Week 2 of ''Beauty and the Geek'' (3.9 million), the third edition of the series, led the 8 p.m. hour in the network's target demographic of adults 18 to 34.</p>
