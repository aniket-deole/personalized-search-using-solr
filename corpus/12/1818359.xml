        <p>George D. Warrington, executive director of New Jersey Transit, said yesterday that he would step down at the end of March to ''pursue other opportunities.'' Mr. Warrington has spent more than three decades in transportation and started at New Jersey Transit when it was formed in 1979. After working his way up to manager in charge of rail operations, he took jobs at the New Jersey Department of Transportation and later Amtrak, where he became president in 1998 and oversaw the introduction of the Acela Express. Mr. Warrington returned to New Jersey Transit in 2002. Under his tenure, ridership reached record highs and multilevel trains were introduced. Gov. Jon S. Corzine will appoint his successor.</p>
