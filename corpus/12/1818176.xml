        <p>Mr. Green lives in a barn in rural Pennsylvania, where he makes charmingly crude stop-motion animation shorts using carved wood figurines, found props and childish drawings. An eyebrow-raising selection of the films is now on view at Bellwether for his first New York solo show. The shorts typically deal with death; though only 28, Mr. Green has a sullenly melancholy bent that's generally at odds with the carefree fare produced by artists his age. A human-size wooden skeleton amputee is a stand-in for an aunt dying of diabetes in ''Carlin'' (2006), above, his most recent film. Another, ''Paulina Hollers'' (2006), tells the story of a troublesome youth who is hit by a bus and ends up in hell. His religious mother shoots herself so that she can rescue him from eternal damnation. Not surprisingly, it doesn't end well, though there are some droll moments as she trawls the netherworld in search of her errant child. The inexplicable allure of these odd, dark films is further enhanced by their unusual improvised soundtracks of the artist riffing on instruments with his buddies while yelling out narration like a crazed preacher. It is all so raw and un-self-conscious that an aura of genuine, endearing authenticity permeates these films. They are among the most original animations devised by an artist in years. (Brent Green: ''Paulina Hollers,'' Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-929-5959, bellwethergallery.com; through Feb. 3.)</p>
