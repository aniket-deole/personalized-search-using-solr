        <p>Representative Yvette D. Clarke, a Brooklyn Democrat who resigned from the City Council after she was elected to Congress in November, endorsed Mathieu Eugene yesterday to succeed her on the Council. Mr. Eugene, a Haitian immigrant who runs a youth recreation center in Flatbush, faces 12 other candidates in a special election on Feb. 20. At a news conference, Ms. Clarke's mother, Una S. T. Clarke, an influential former councilwoman, and the Haitian-American Association for Progressive Action, a political group, also endorsed Mr. Eugene. His main rivals for the seat include Jesse E. Hamilton III, a Democratic district leader with support from several unions; Jennifer N. James, a political activist who raised money for Ms. Clarke's Congressional race; and Wellington Sharpe, who runs a child care company.</p>
