        <p>The governor and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, below, had a lot to discuss on Thursday, off to the side of a dinner held by the Manhattan Democratic Committee.</p>
        <p>Word had just come down that a special panel of three former comptrollers had winnowed a long list of candidates to replace former Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi down to three, passing over all of the Assembly Democrats who were prospects. Since the Legislature has the ultimate say, Mr. Silver has said he might ignore the panel's advice.</p>
        <p>That, however, could lead to his first major battle with the new governor, who insisted that the former comptrollers vet the picks and has said that the ultimate choice should come from the list of three.</p>
        <p>The good news Thursday night? The two men were in a corner for an extended period of time, and ''both were smiling,'' one attendee said. But among others at the dinner, emotions were running high: ''Lots of Assembly members were ranting at Shelly's chief of staff.''</p>
