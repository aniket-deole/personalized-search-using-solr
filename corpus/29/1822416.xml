        <p>Although Sprint Nextel had been the largest account at the TBWA/Chiat/Day New York office, the agency decided against participating in the review, according to a statement, ''with a clear understanding of Sprint's challenged business situation.'' The TBWA/Chiat/Day office in Playa del Rey, Calif., works with Apple, which is collaborating with a Sprint Nextel competitor, AT&amp;T, on the new iPhone.</p>
