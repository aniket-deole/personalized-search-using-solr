        <p>A 53-year-old man was found dead yesterday morning in his small room inside a nine-story building run by a nonprofit group in Morrisania, the police said. The man, whom the authorities did not identify, was killed by blunt trauma to the torso, the police said. The killing occurred shortly before 4 a.m. at a building, known as Webster House, at 1075 Webster Avenue, the police said. The building is run by the group, Volunteers of America, under an agreement with the city. Residents said the man, who they said was named Thomas and was also known as Mac, was found lying with the door to his room open. ''I heard rumbling and fighting,'' said Umberto Sanchez, who lives in a nearby room. A spokeswoman for Volunteers of America referred calls to the city's Department of Homeless Services. Nobody at that agency could be reached yesterday.</p>
