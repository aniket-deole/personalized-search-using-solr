        <p>The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen  (Virgin)</p>
        <p>Mood music doesn't get any moodier than the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, a new art-rock collaboration led by Damon Albarn of Gorillaz and Blur. A queasy look at contemporary London, the album is full of crackheads and battered dreamers, soldiers and kids who ''drink all day/'cause the country is at war.'' The music is thick with dub-laced dread and barely seems to crawl, quite a surprise given the hip-shaking pedigrees of the talent on hand: Tony Allen, the drummer and Afrobeat pioneer, and Danger Mouse, half of Gnarls Barkley and this album's producer. In a group photo the bassist Paul Simonon, formerly of the Clash, has black eyes and a bandaged nose, as if he had been clubbed for trying to rock too hard.</p>

        <p>Mood music doesn't get any moodier than the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, a new art-rock collaboration led by Damon Albarn of Gorillaz and Blur. A queasy look at contemporary London, the album is full of crackheads and battered dreamers, soldiers and kids who ''drink all day/'cause the country is at war.'' The music is thick with dub-laced dread and barely seems to crawl, quite a surprise given the hip-shaking pedigrees of the talent on hand: Tony Allen, the drummer and Afrobeat pioneer, and Danger Mouse, half of Gnarls Barkley and this album's producer. In a group photo the bassist Paul Simonon, formerly of the Clash, has black eyes and a bandaged nose, as if he had been clubbed for trying to rock too hard.</p>
        <p>Considering the way Gorillaz mix doom with slinky beats, the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen is willfully hookless, though the music has a somber beauty. On ''80's Life'' Danger Mouse tries to cheer everyone up with doo-wop choruses and electronic pings and squiggles. Mr. Albarn is upset about Iraq and his own lost innocence, calling England a ''stroppy little island of mixed-up people.'' Pushing 40, he longs for eras he once condemned (see Blur's ''Parklife,'' from 1994) and seems almost paralyzed by sadness. But finally, on the last song, the sun takes a clich√©d trip ''out of the clouds,'' and the band makes some noise, unable to wallow any longer.</p>
