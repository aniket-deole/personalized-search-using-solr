        <p>At least there is history for Roger Federer to play against, because for the moment, no man is much of a match.</p>
        <p>Fernando González gave it all he had, or at least all he had left, in Sunday's final at the Australian Open. With his forehand working and Federer's slightly off target, he even managed to serve for the opening set.</p>
        <p>But despite all of González's emotion in motion, the coolest head in tennis once again ruled the evening as Federer successfully defended his title in Melbourne and won his 10th Grand Slam singles title, 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4.</p>
        <p>Federer has won 36 consecutive matches over all, and six of the past seven major titles. No other active player has won more than three Grand Slam titles. Federer is tied for fifth on the career list with Bill Tilden, who won his majors between 1920 and 1930. Pete Sampras is atop the list with 14.</p>
        <p>Federer, still only 25, is moving rapidly into range, and Sampras has already said that he is convinced that Federer will pass him, perhaps sooner than later.</p>
        <p>Tiger Woods is not yet convinced he will lose his race with Federer. Woods, who met Federer at last year's United States Open, has befriended him. According to Federer, Woods often teases him that he is going to break Jack Nicklaus's career record of 18 Grand Slam golf victories before Federer breaks Sampras's record. Woods is six victories from his target, Federer is four from his.</p>
        <p>''He loves it; he likes to beat me up,'' said Federer, who spoke with Woods while he was in Australia. ''He says he's going to break it first. I hope just to get close to it. He is more, I think, driven than me. I'm maybe more laid-back in terms of looking at all these records and matches, but he really is so driven by the majors and by beating Nicklaus's record.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''But I always hope well for Tiger, and not that I'm going to break the record the first. I hope he breaks it as well. I hope we both do.''</p>
        <p>If Federer's opponents had hoped that all his success in the past three seasons would leave him feeling sated, his performance here, in the year's first Grand Slam event, was an unmistakable signal that he remains eager and excellent.</p>
        <p>For the first time in his groundbreaking career, Federer swept through a Grand Slam tournament without dropping a set, and the only set points he faced were the two he saved in the first set Sunday against González, of Chile.</p>
        <p>It was a terrific set, full of bold shotmaking and lunging defense, with González's blocs of fans inside and outside Rod Laver Arena providing plenty of positive reinforcement with their chants of ''Chi-Chi-Chi, Le-Le-Le, Chile! Chile!''</p>
        <p>Until this tournament, González had never advanced past the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam event. But with an improved backhand and improved tactics and confidence, thanks to his new coach, Larry Stefanki, he had broken through by beating four members of the top 20.</p>
        <p>Against Tommy Haas in the semifinals, he finished with a stunning 42 winners and only 3 unforced errors. A Grand Slam final, however, particularly against Federer, is a more unnerving proposition. There is the protocol: the photographs at the net beforehand, the aura of gravitas that seeps into the expressions of the officials.</p>
        <p>It takes time to adjust, and the 10th-seeded González, who will rise to No. 5 in the world after his run here, did a much better job than most debutantes. But he could not maintain the same level of play against Federer.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't as good as in my other matches, but the guy on the other side of the net also applies more pressure than the guys in my other matches,'' González said.</p>
        <p>After only eight points, González already had more unforced errors than in the entire match against Haas. But Federer was also not nearly as sharp early as he had been in his semifinal demolition of Andy Roddick.</p>
        <p>His signature shot is the midcourt forehand, which he can take either direction into the corners, but he failed to convert on several such shots in the early stages of the match. And in the ninth game, González put together two great backhand passing shots in a row to break Federer's serve and earn the chance to serve for the set at 5-4.</p>
        <p>At 40-15, after Federer hit a backhand return wide, it looked as if González might transform this final into something more compelling than the latest Federer coronation. But on the first set point, Federer pushed forward to the net, and González hit a hasty forehand passing shot directly at him, which Federer volleyed away for a winner. On the second set point, González kicked a first serve to the backhand and was greeted with a deep return. He responded with an edgy forehand unforced error.</p>
        <p>It was deuce, and Federer would soon be back to 5-5. Though González saved four set points on his serve in the 12th game, he could not dig his teeth into the tie breaker, falling behind, 0-5, then seeking treatment for a sore right shoulder after losing the set.</p>
        <p>The rest was less suspenseful, as is so often the case with one of the best players and front-runners in history.</p>
        <p>''The first set was the set Fernando had to win to have any effect on Roger's psyche, to have any effect on his nervous system,'' Stefanki said.</p>
        <p>Federer did indeed look much more at ease after that, controlling his own serve with little difficulty and cutting his unforced errors in half. He claimed the match and his third Australian Open title by holding his serve at love, shouting with delight, then rolling onto his back on the green hardcourt.</p>
        <p>The last man to win here without dropping a set was Ken Rosewall in 1971, and Rosewall was in the President's Box on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy to be the guy who follows up on you; it's a great honor,'' Federer said in his postmatch remarks as he gestured toward Rosewall.</p>
        <p>It was a telling moment, because Federer, at this stage, has much more in common with the game's former luminaries than his current rivals. He is now, for example, 10-0 against González.</p>
        <p>Federer's only loss in the past seven Grand Slam events came at the French Open last year, when Rafael Nadal deprived him of a shot at the Grand Slam by beating him in the final. But after this performance, the drumroll will start again as the clay-court season and Roland Garros approach.</p>
        <p>''Well, I think last year was really the first year I thought if everything goes perfectly well, there might be a chance,'' Federer said of the Grand Slam. ''And I got so awfully close looking back, but the French Open is the second one. It's such a tough one to win. I've given myself chances the last two years, but Rafa has been so dominant on that surface.''</p>
        <p>That is true, but Federer has been dominant on everything else, and he has already shown that he is a quick learner and, above all, a great closer.</p>
