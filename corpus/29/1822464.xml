        <p>Study Of the 2,114 sex offenders who live in New York City and are listed in the state's publicly available database, 85 percent live within five blocks of a school and 32 percent within two blocks of a school, according to a report released yesterday by Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Mr. Weiner's staff used mapping software to analyze records from the database, which was expanded in July and lists Level 2 and Level 3 sex offenders, who must register for life. (Sex offenders are assigned a risk level from 1 to 3 based on the nature of the crime, the victim's age and an offender's prior record.) Though there is no law that restricts where a sex offender may live, Mr. Weiner has pushed for action. In addition to seeking federal aid to study and monitor sex offenders, Mr. Weiner called for requiring offenders to notify the authorities if they have profiles on social-networking Web sites like MySpace, and if they live near schools, to submit to monitoring using global positioning satellite technology.</p>
