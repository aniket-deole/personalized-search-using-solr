        <p>Pretty Ricky  ''Late Night Special'' (Atlantic)</p>
        <p>At least the members of Pretty Ricky have their priorities straight. Pretty Ricky is a rapping-and-singing boy band: four brothers in their 20s from Florida, all devoted to the task of making young female listeners scream. And on their single-minded second album, ''Late Night Special,'' they take turns chatting up the fans. One of the more memorable requests: ''Let me do you after school, like some homework, but please/Don't gimme no S.T.D.'s.'' Pro-homework, anti-herpes. Who could argue with that?</p>

        <p>Pretty Ricky  ''Late Night Special'' (Atlantic)</p>
        <p>At least the members of Pretty Ricky have their priorities straight. Pretty Ricky is a rapping-and-singing boy band: four brothers in their 20s from Florida, all devoted to the task of making young female listeners scream. And on their single-minded second album, ''Late Night Special,'' they take turns chatting up the fans. One of the more memorable requests: ''Let me do you after school, like some homework, but please/Don't gimme no S.T.D.'s.'' Pro-homework, anti-herpes. Who could argue with that?</p>
        <p>Well perhaps a few nervous parents could. But if your goal is to be a member of the smuttiest boy band in the country, you can't worry about censorious moms. You have to keep right on singing, or rapping, secure in your knowledge that a double-entendre is one entendre too many. Suffice it to say that ''Up and Down'' isn't about the price of oil.</p>
        <p>Pretty Ricky's debut, ''Bluestars,'' has sold more than 800,000 copies. And ''Late Night Special'' is a well-made and weirdly likable follow-up. Rowdy (if rudimentary) rhymes enliven the slow jams and silky (or, at any rate, rayon-y) refrains make the club tracks even smoother. It could even be argued that there's something brave about the way these fellows own up to their bad intentions. Lots of boy-banders promise to love you forever; these are honest enough to ask instead, ''Can I put a little peer pressure on ya?''</p>
