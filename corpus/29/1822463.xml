        <p>Rent-to-own stores charge exorbitant prices for televisions, appliances, mattresses and other items and disproportionately take aim at black, Hispanic and low-income consumers who have limited access to credit, according to an investigative report that the City Council released yesterday. A 1986 state law exempted rent-to-own companies from small-loan usury caps; and under the law, because the stores retain legal title to rented items until the final payment is made, the product can be repossessed if a payment is missed. Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, introduced a bill in Congress last year that would force the industry to disclose more information about prices and hidden fees, and to abide by state limits on interest and financing charges. Assemblyman J. Gary Pretlow, a Westchester Democrat, introduced a similar bill last year in the Legislature. The Council members who released the report -- Maria del Carmen Arroyo of the Bronx and Leroy G. Comrie and Eric N. Gioia of Queens -- said they supported both bills. Officials at Rent-A-Center of Plano, Tex., the country's leading rent-to-own operator, did not respond to e-mail and phone messages requesting comment.</p>
