        <p>Editorial says small group of victims' families has regrettably decided to mount public campaign against compromise on emotional issue of how to place names of dead at 9/11 memorial; holds that ground zero cannot be turned into private memorial</p>

        <p>For a while, it seemed as if the emotional issue of how to place the names of the dead at the 9/11 memorial had finally been resolved. And for nearly everyone, including most of the 9/11 families, it has, thanks to a compromise engineered last month by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But a small group of victims' families has regrettably decided to mount a public campaign against the compromise.</p>
        <p>They are trying to discourage contributions to the memorial until the victims' names appear exactly the way they want them, listing the age, corporate affiliation and floor on which each person worked. We fear that this effort will only add to the distress of other families who have been waiting for years for what is, after all, a public memorial.</p>

        <p>For a while, it seemed as if the emotional issue of how to place the names of the dead at the 9/11 memorial had finally been resolved. And for nearly everyone, including most of the 9/11 families, it has, thanks to a compromise engineered last month by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But a small group of victims' families has regrettably decided to mount a public campaign against the compromise.</p>
        <p>They are trying to discourage contributions to the memorial until the victims' names appear exactly the way they want them, listing the age, corporate affiliation and floor on which each person worked. We fear that this effort will only add to the distress of other families who have been waiting for years for what is, after all, a public memorial.</p>
        <p>It's hard to imagine a group of people who have been listened to more intently than this group of family members. Their views have helped to shape or reshape nearly every aspect of the redevelopment of ground zero -- and especially the memorial. They had George Pataki's ear when he was governor, and they succeeded in shaping the debate about ground zero in ways that were sometimes polarizing. Out of respect for their loss, everyone has listened to them and tried to address their concerns.</p>
        <p>But ground zero cannot be turned into a private memorial. If Cantor Fitzgerald, for example, feels it is important to create its own separate memorial to its terrible loss on that day, it should certainly do so. But the public memorial must be more expansive than that. There is a stark beauty and essential simplicity to the proposed listing of names as it now stands. It honors the nature of public memory, as well as the role the 9/11 museum will play in telling a fuller history of that day.</p>
        <p>As painful as the private loss of this small group of mourners is, it must be accommodated as part of the larger public loss.</p>
