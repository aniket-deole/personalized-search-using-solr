        <p>To respond to the challenge posed by digital media, newspaper executives are being told to listen to their readers. The San Francisco Chronicle is doing just that: It is posting some of the voice mail messages left for reporters and editors as audio files on its Web site, SFGate.com.</p>
        <p>The first such voice mail message, posted Wednesday under the rubric ''Correct Me If I'm Wrong '' is about an error the reader says appeared in the Aug. 29 Chronicle, on page B6. ''The subhead is a tautology -- it says 'Forest service begins testing pilotless drones,' '' the increasingly agitated caller says. ''Is there any other kind of drone? You tell me right now, is there any other kind of drone other than a pilotless drone? Isn't that what a drone is, an unmanned aircraft?''</p>

        <p>To respond to the challenge posed by digital media, newspaper executives are being told to listen to their readers. The San Francisco Chronicle is doing just that: It is posting some of the voice mail messages left for reporters and editors as audio files on its Web site, SFGate.com.</p>
        <p>The first such voice mail message, posted Wednesday under the rubric ''Correct Me If I'm Wrong '' is about an error the reader says appeared in the Aug. 29 Chronicle, on page B6. ''The subhead is a tautology -- it says 'Forest service begins testing pilotless drones,' '' the increasingly agitated caller says. ''Is there any other kind of drone? You tell me right now, is there any other kind of drone other than a pilotless drone? Isn't that what a drone is, an unmanned aircraft?''</p>
        <p>Putting voice mail messages from readers online was the idea of Phil Bronstein, the vice president and editor of The Chronicle. ''This is about listening to your readers,'' he said. ''Newspapers used to be a lot more lively than they are now, and they could definitely stand some of that.'' If readers respond well, he added, the paper might add ''dramatic readings'' of some of the letters that come in.</p>
        <p>Judging from posted comments, listeners find it amusing. ''Some people have said it's pretty strange and others have thought it was hysterically funny,'' Mr. Bronstein said.</p>
        <p>And, as perhaps is inevitable, somebody always wants the last word. ''Remotely piloted vehicles do have pilots,'' said a reader, whose call was also posted online. ''It's just that the pilot is sitting elsewhere doing his piloting by radio.''</p>
