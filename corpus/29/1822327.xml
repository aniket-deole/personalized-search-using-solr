Beloved father of James Paley and Janet Sapir; Father-in-law of Donald Sapir and Sharon Paley; devoted Grandfather of Jeremy and Erica Paley and Jesse Sapir; and Matthew and Sonya Sapir; adoring great-grandfather of Colden Sapir. Predeceased by his wife of 49 years Marilyn Breakstone Paley. You were a caring and compassionate Physician, a brilliant Diagnostician, and most importantly a loving Father, Grandfather, and great-grandfather. What incredible strength you demonstrated in your sight against Cancer. We love you and miss you; you will be with us always. A Private memorial will be held at a later date.</p>
