        <p>Miguel Abreu Gallery  36 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side  Through Sunday</p>
        <p>Sam Lewitt's art displays a lot of brainpower, extensive research and no compunction about leaving the viewer in the dust, as forecast by a dense news release and an even denser seven-page artist's statement. But this solo debut show is still worth seeing -- and reading -- for its hermetic, oddly elegiac atmosphere regarding books, the storage and organization of knowledge and advertising; its meticulous renditions of styles of writing and graphic design; and its rather exquisite beauty as an entity.</p>

        <p>Miguel Abreu Gallery  36 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side  Through Sunday</p>
        <p>Sam Lewitt's art displays a lot of brainpower, extensive research and no compunction about leaving the viewer in the dust, as forecast by a dense news release and an even denser seven-page artist's statement. But this solo debut show is still worth seeing -- and reading -- for its hermetic, oddly elegiac atmosphere regarding books, the storage and organization of knowledge and advertising; its meticulous renditions of styles of writing and graphic design; and its rather exquisite beauty as an entity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewitt takes full advantage of Mr. Abreu's funky, white-on-white gallery space. His show centers on the dust jackets of eight books fastened to the walls as if floating in limbo, which is not inaccurate: the jackets are meticulously made fictions in every respect, including the lengthy back-cover synopses that are the heart of the show. These wry little tracts create a slightly cloudy web of self-reference that touches on computers, graphic design, mollusks and forensics, while providing the reader with tips, clues and incentives.</p>
        <p>In the end you may identify more than you might like with Edward Clark Potter, the sculptor who made the stone lions flanking the entrance of the New York Public Library. An ambiguous text that may be a photocopy of the inside flap of a dust jacket informs us that, when asked about the symbolism of the lions -- who were eventually, but only eventually, named Patience and Fortitude -- he replied, ''I don't know.'' When prodded further, he said, ''I'm sure I don't know.''</p>
        <p>It confirms your worst suspicions about public monuments, if not public institutions in general.</p>
