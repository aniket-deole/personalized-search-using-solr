        <p>Antiwar Groups Take the Fight to Congress  Tens of thousands of demonstrators plan a major antiwar march in Washington this weekend. But even the most liberal Democratic senators do not appear eager to align themselves with it, so the organizers are also carrying out a sophisticated lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>PAGE A14</p>
        <p>Bloomberg Projects Surplus Fed by the Real Estate Boom  Mayor Bloomberg projected that New York City would have a $3.9 billion surplus to carry over into its budget for the next fiscal year, allowing him to cut taxes and set aside money for future expenses.</p>
        <p>PAGE B1</p>
        <p>U.S. Aid for Afghanistan  President Bush plans to ask Congress for $10.6 billion in aid for Afghanistan, primarily to beef up the country's security forces.</p>
        <p>PAGE A6</p>
        <p>Once Unread, Now Hot  A little-known book of essays about 19th-century Russian intellectuals is in high demand, thanks to Tom Stoppard's latest play.</p>
        <p>WEEKEND, PAGE E1</p>
        <p>An Outsider Genius  An exhibition of works by Martín Ramírez, like ''Untitled (Tunnel With Cars and Buses),'' below, renders distinctions between insider and outsider art null and void. A review by Roberta Smith.</p>
