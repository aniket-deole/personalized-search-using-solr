        <p>India sealed a wide-ranging package of agreements with Russia on Thursday, the first day of a summit meeting intended to demonstrate that their longstanding relationship had not deteriorated as a result of India's growing engagement with the United States.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement issued after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, Russia offered to build four new nuclear power plants in India, in addition to the two reactors it is already building here.</p>
        <p>''Energy security is the most important of the emerging dimensions of our strategic partnership,'' Mr. Singh said. ''Russia's position as a global leader on energy issues is widely recognized.''</p>
        <p>As India's economy booms, the prospect of growing energy shortages has become a major driver of its foreign policy. Describing Russia as a ''special friend'' of India, Mr. Singh added that despite the ''sea change'' that had occurred in international affairs over the past decade, ''Russia remains indispensable to India's strategic interests.''</p>
        <p>This was Mr. Putin's first visit to India since the United States agreed to cooperate with India on its civilian nuclear power program last year, and the Indian government was at pains to show that the agreement had done nothing to dilute the warmth of India's affection for its historic partner, Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singh went to the airport to meet the Russian leader as he stepped off his plane, a pointed gesture of respect previously extended only to President Bush and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin will be the guest of honor at India's Republic Day celebrations on Friday. Much of the weaponry on display will be Soviet-made, a testament to the earlier close friendship between the countries in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
