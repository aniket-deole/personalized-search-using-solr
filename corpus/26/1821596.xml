        <p>A 2-year-old boy was found dead in his Kingsbridge home yesterday after spending the night trapped inside a plastic storage container that he had climbed into during a hide-and-seek game with his siblings, the police said. The boy's mother, whom neighbors identified as Rosa Lopez, discovered the 2-year-old, Anthony Pena, unconscious around 5 a.m., the police said, and he was pronounced dead when medics arrived at the apartment, at 3034 Albany Crescent. Ms. Lopez told the police that she put Anthony, his 6-year-old brother and his 3-year-old sister to bed about 9 p.m. on Wednesday, the police said. The siblings are believed to have shut the container with their brother inside, the police added. No charges have been filed. Neighbors reported hearing loud noises and fighting coming from the apartment during the night. The medical examiner is expected to conduct an autopsy today.</p>
