        <p>BERKOWITZ--H. David. The law firm of Snow Becker Krauss P.C. deeply mourns the loss of our beloved former colleague, David Berkowitz. David was an integral part of the firms success for many years. He possessed a keen mind, extraordinary character and a quiet and calm demeanor. These attributes were coupled with a ready sense of humor and a fierce work ethic, as well as the rare ability to explain complex tax law in simple terms. We will greatly miss him, and we honor his memory. On behalf of our colleagues, we extend heartfelt condolences to his wife Kathy, their children Stacey and Peter, and the entire Berkowitz family.</p>
