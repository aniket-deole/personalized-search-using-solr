        <p>LOESSER--Hannah, beloved daughter of Broadway composer Frank Loesser and singer Jo Sullivan Loesser, died in New York City Thursday, January 25th, of Cancer. She was 44 years old. Ms. Loesser was an artist of note. Her unique work consisted of oils, pastels and mixed media, ranging from somber landscapes to portraits of favorite rock stars and film greats to a series of posters celebrating famous plays and films. She had very successful exhibitions at the 70th Art Gallery in New York City, the prestigious Williams Gallery in Princeton, the famed Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton, and at galleries on Sanibel Island and in Hollywood, Florida. Ms. Loesser was a graduate of Marymount Manhattan College in New York. She also studied painting, drawing, the techniques and practice of Chinese painting and graphic arts at the Art Student League, the Chinese Institute, the North Light Art School and the National Academy of Art &amp; Design. She used her talent and training in assisting with art therapy for developmentally disabled children at Kennedy Study Center and the New York Council on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In recent years, she became a devotee of computer art. She is survived by her mother, her grandmother Eileen Sullivan, her sister Emily (Stephenson), her half sister Susan Loesser (Gallagher), her half brother John Loesser, her brothers in law, Denis Gallagher and Don Stephenson, her aunt Jerri Hammond and several nieces and nephews. She is preceded in death by her father in 1969. Services will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on Saturday, January 27th, at 11:30 A.M. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the North Shore Animal League America (nsalamerica.org.)</p>
