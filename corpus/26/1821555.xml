        <p>''Frost/Nixon,'' the new Peter Morgan play about the series of interviews David Frost, the British talk show host, conducted with former President Richard M. Nixon, has set its Broadway dates. Previews begin on March 31 at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, with opening night set for April 22. The play, starring Michael Sheen as Mr. Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon, is now being presented in London's West End after a sold-out run at the Donmar Warehouse. Primary Stages has announced three-fourths of its 2007-8 season: ''Dividing the Estate,'' a 1989 play by Horton Foote; ''Something You Did'' by Willy Holtzman (''Hearts''); and ''Opus'' by Michael Hollinger (''An Empty Plate in the Café du Grand Boeuf''). The fourth production has not been decided. Andrew Lloyd Webber will most likely appear as a guest judge on the Feb. 11 episode of ''You're the One That I Want,'' the ''Grease'' reality show audition on NBC, according to a spokesman for Mr. Webber. It's a logical move for Mr. Webber, who wants to bring his own casting show to the United States after the success in Britain of his audition show, ''How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?,'' for a West End revival of ''The Sound of Music.''</p>
