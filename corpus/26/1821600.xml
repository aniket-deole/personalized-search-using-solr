        <p>The Police Department announced yesterday that it had dismantled two drug organizations that were selling crack cocaine and marijuana in Washington Heights. One group was operating out of eight apartments in the Polo Grounds Houses, on Eighth Avenue near 155th Street, the police said. The other group, a subset of the Bloods street gang known as the Best Out, was earning about $10,000 a week from street-level sales in the same area, the police said. Officers began investigating the two groups last year, the police said. In raids yesterday, the police arrested more than two dozen people and seized cash, narcotics and two .22-caliber revolvers.</p>
