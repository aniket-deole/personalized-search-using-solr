There will be 342 units, including studios, one- and two-bedroom suites and four penthouses, all in a renovated 16-story apartment building. The units will include furniture by Marcel Wanders, who is also the interior and landscaping designer of the project, and will be sold in whole ownership. They may be placed in a revenue-sharing rental program when owners are away. A bar in the lobby will extend outdoors to a pool area, which will have a cafe and cabanas, and inside there will be a fine-dining restaurant, a lounge and a spa and fitness center. Residents and guests will have access to the beach at the Delano.</p>

Owners will also receive membership in a nearby club that offers golf and fishing.</p>
