        <p>Opens today in Manhattan  Directed by Barry Strugatz  Not rated; 88 minutes</p>
        <p>Aliens offer a cure for earthling ennui in ''From Other Worlds,'' a limp sci-fi comedy with fewer laughs than a meeting of Abductees Anonymous. When Joanne (Cara Buono), a despondent wife and mother, develops a fascination with dead fish and a fan-shaped skin blemish, she naturally suspects an otherworldly cause. Grappling with blackouts and an unreliable Brooklyn accent, she heads for a U.F.O. support group at which neighborhood losers vie for the extraterrestrial-sighting record and, apparently, the title of Most Unfortunate Hair.</p>

        <p>Aliens offer a cure for earthling ennui in ''From Other Worlds,'' a limp sci-fi comedy with fewer laughs than a meeting of Abductees Anonymous. When Joanne (Cara Buono), a despondent wife and mother, develops a fascination with dead fish and a fan-shaped skin blemish, she naturally suspects an otherworldly cause. Grappling with blackouts and an unreliable Brooklyn accent, she heads for a U.F.O. support group at which neighborhood losers vie for the extraterrestrial-sighting record and, apparently, the title of Most Unfortunate Hair.</p>
        <p>There Joanne meets Abraham (Isaach De Bankol√©), a dour African who sells bootleg watches and bears an identical skin discoloration. Joining forces, they track down a garrulous alien who instructs them -- in a vocal hybrid of Liberace and the police inspector from ''Young Frankenstein'' -- on how to save the world. Instructions on how to save the script are not forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Flirting with fantasy, farce and social commentary and committing to none, the writer and director Barry Strugatz pads his film with ill-conceived characters (Melissa Leo as a coy librarian) and embarrassing puns (''You've been acting really spaced out recently''). Meanwhile his two leads, displaying less chemistry than an American high-school transcript, stagger toward their respective awakenings like dazed lemmings in a movie that never finds a consistent tone.</p>
