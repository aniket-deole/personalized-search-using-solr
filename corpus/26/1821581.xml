        <p>A woman who won a car in a contest sponsored by a Spanish-language radio station is suing the station and its parent company, saying they withheld the car from her because she is an illegal immigrant. The woman, Maribel Nava Alvarez, filed suit in late November in Chicago against the local station, WLEY 107.9 FM, and the Spanish Broadcasting System, said her lawyer, Robert M. Romero. The suit, only now being reported in English-language news media, alleges breach of contract because the station refused to give Ms. Alvarez the Corvette she won in a raffle at a fair on July 4, 2005, Mr. Romero said. In a statement, the station and its parent company said they could not give Ms. Alvarez the car because they were unable to verify the tax-reporting information required by the Internal Revenue Service in awarding prizes valued at more than $500.</p>
