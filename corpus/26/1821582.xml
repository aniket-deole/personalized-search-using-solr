        <p>Responding to an increase in violent crime in New Orleans, the Department of Justice announced it would assign agents to the Police Department ''around the clock'' to help identify cases that could be prosecuted by federal officials. In other federal efforts to help beleaguered local law enforcement officials, the department also said it would send more agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, expand the authority of Drug Enforcement Administration agents and extend financing for six additional federal prosecutors temporarily posted to the city.</p>
