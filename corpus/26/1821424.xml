        <p>With this year's Oscar contest including a showdown between a lovably dysfunctional family squeezed into a yellow minivan and a pair of undercover agents with peach fuzz on their cheeks and Jack Nicholson on their hands, it is necessary to look to the past for the kind of high-toned entertainment that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences once considered worthy of its awards. Peter Glenville's ''Becket'' was nominated for 12 Oscars in 1965, pitting Peter O'Toole (as a petulant King Henry II, above right) and Richard Burton (as Thomas à Becket, the king's best friend, who takes his patronage job too seriously when he is appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, above left) against each other in the best-actor category. But in the end, only the screenwriter Edward Anhalt went home with a statuette, for adapting Jean Anouilh's internationally successful stage play. Mr. Glenville (''The Comedians'') was no filmmaker, and the only cinematic aspect of the film is the use of Canterbury Cathedral. But when the legendary drinking buddies Burton and Mr. O'Toole get together for their verbal duels, the king's English flows in great, sonorous quantities. ''Becket'' was independently produced, by the veteran Hollywood entrepreneur Hal Wallis (taking a break from his Elvis films) and Mr. O'Toole's own company, and it has been slipping in and out of distribution for years. (VHS copies can still be found on eBay.) But the film has now been acquired by Slowhand Cinema and will open today in a new 35-millimeter print for a one week engagement. (Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org; $10.50.)</p>
