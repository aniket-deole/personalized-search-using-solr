        <p>LAVELLE--John W.With broken hearts and profound sadness, the New York State Assembly mourns the passing of our friend and colleague, Assembly Member John Lavelle. John's tough, hard-nosed approach to politics could not shadow the enormity of his heart. He served his beloved Staten Island community with passion, enthusiasm and dedication. He embodied the true spirit of public service. We valued John Lavelle's counsel, his leadership, and most of all, his friendship. It was an honor and a privilege to serve with him. John Lavelle's advocacy improved public education, ensured the accessibility of affordable health care, eased the struggle of those fighting addiction, and enhanced the quality of life for Staten Island's working families. There is no clearer symbol of John's care and compassion than his decision to donate his organs so that others might have a better life. The shock of his passing reverberates throughout state government. We will miss him dearly. Speaker Sheldon Silver and the New York State Assembly offer our sympathy and our prayers to the Lavelle family, to Assembly Member John Lavelle's many friends, and to the citizens of Staten Island. Sheldon Silver, Speaker of the NYS Assembly</p>
        <p>LAVELLE--John. The Board of Directors, staff and participants of AHRC NYC mourn the loss of John Lavelle, Assemblyman from Staten Island, a long time friend of our Agency. We extend our sincere condolences to his family. Laura Kennedy, President Michael Goldfarb, Executive Director</p>
