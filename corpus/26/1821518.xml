        <p>It is a Washington ritual. Almost every year a lawmaker proposes withholding the automatic annual cost-of-living pay increase from members of Congress in the name of fiscal responsibility and populist reform.</p>
        <p>Some members vote for it, but the proposal usually fails. And even the reformers get their raise.</p>
        <p>The Senate, at least, may be raising the price of such public displays of self-sacrifice. In the rush to pass a major ethics bill on Jan. 18, the Senate approved a provision that would deny the pay increase to any individual member who voted against it, even if it passed.</p>
        <p>Last year, a senator would have lost $3,100 out of a salary of $165,200. (The Senate has delayed taking a pay increase this year until after it finishes debating whether to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time in nearly 10 years.)</p>
        <p>The penalty for opposing the raise is the work of Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who called votes against the increase ''the greatest single hypocrisy every year.''</p>
        <p>''All the press releases hit the home state,'' he said in a speech last year introducing the idea. ''And then, of course, it is defeated, and they end up taking the increase anyway.''</p>
        <p>The idea is a rare attempt to punish lawmakers financially on the basis of how they vote. Could the Senate, for example, cut a member's pay for a vote to increase the deficit? For one against a new minimum wage?</p>
        <p>''It is a precedent that could lead to a slippery slope,'' said Kenneth A. Gross, an expert on political law. But, he acknowledged, lawmakers voting against a raise ''would have to put their money where their mouth is.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic and Republican Senate leaders incorporated the measure into their bipartisan ethics proposal, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 96 to 2 without further discussion.</p>
        <p>But in an interview this week a spokesman for the Senate rules committee suggested that a House and Senate conference might revisit the provision before it became law.</p>
