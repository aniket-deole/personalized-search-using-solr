        <p>Seven people were arrested on prostitution charges at Scores West Side, a Chelsea nightclub, after an undercover operation on Wednesday night, the police said yesterday. Several dancers at the club engaged officers in sexual conversation and said sexual acts could be performed in rooms rented inside the club, the police said. The operation followed a complaint of prostitution at the club. Four women were arrested on charges of prostitution, and one woman and two men were charged with permitting prostitution, the police said. Mark Bederow, a lawyer for all seven, said his clients pleaded not guilty during their arraignments yesterday.</p>
