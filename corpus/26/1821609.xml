        <p>Follow William Grimes to his home of 27 years, Astoria -- ''the gateway to Queens,'' and consequently, to Korean grilled jellyfish, Polish smoked ham, Greek pastries, Mexican fruit tarts and a plethora of international markets. ''My culinary life has been transformed by the Gold City Supermarket,'' he says. The produce and meat departments are mind-boggling, the condiments dazzling, and ''the fish counter is dramatic,'' he says. ''I once saw an eel make a break for freedom, slithering across the produce-department floor.'' All this and ''the Constant Possibility of Erasure'' -- a ''witty and elegiac'' group show, says Holland Cotter, ''exploring transience as an existential reality and as a conceptual ploy in late-20th-century art'' -- is surely worth a trip on the 7 train.</p>
