        <p>The city is considering legal action against employees of a Queens community center after an audit revealed that they received $178,530 in questionable payments, officials said. The audit, released yesterday by Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., was ordered after suspicions of financial irregularities at the center, the Pomonok Neighborhood Center in Flushing, surfaced in 2005. The center has city and state contracts to provide after-school programs, housing assistance and other services. According to the audit, the center's youth program director may have padded the time sheets for himself, his daughter, his live-in companion and her son, who were hired in violation of rules against nepotism. The audit also questioned salary payments to 27 other people.</p>
