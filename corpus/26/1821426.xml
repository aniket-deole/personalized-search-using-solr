        <p>If you saw Susan Marshall's ''Cloudless'' last March at Dance Theater Workshop, you already know that it deserves a second look. Thankfully, the powers that be -- or those that were, in the case of Cathy Edwards, who until recently was artistic director -- thought so, too. The work, a Bessie Award-winning dance suite, was brought back for a two-week return. Ms. Marshall's Web site (susanmarshallandcompany.org) describes the simply named solos, duets and group pieces (18 in all) in ''Cloudless'' as ''short-form narratives,'' but to this eye the small but expansive dances read more like poems, governed by a lyrical internal logic. ''Cloudless'' represented a move away from full-length work for Ms. Marshall. It's true -- these aren't large-scale works -- but the imagination at play is so grand. Vignettes, many dealing with intimacy and sexual power struggles, are both individual pieces and parts of a sweeping whole. Props and theater share time with abstract, yet telling, dance. As the title perhaps implies, Ms. Marshall gives a very clear view of complex, fraught relationships. Her eye extends to her dancers, who have all been well chosen. Whether strapped to a ladder, serving one another other tea in highly unorthodox fashion or making minute movements count for a lot, dancers like Petra van Noort ( shown with Joseph Poulson, above) grab attention and hold it, hard. (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Saturday nights at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, dtw.org; $25; $15 for members, students and 65+.)</p>
