        <p>As New York City's aspiring singers descended upon ''American Idol'' on Wednesday, the episode drew 33.6 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m., according to Nielsen's estimates, giving Fox another commanding ratings victory on the night. CBS was a distant second in total viewers, as ''CSI: New York'' (13.4 million) led the 10 o'clock hour. CBS's new reality show, ''Armed and Famous'' (4.7 million), sank to fourth place at 8. NBC edged out CBS in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic for the night, winning second place behind Fox with the help of ''Deal or No Deal'' at 9 (10.1 million). Nielsen also estimated that the State of the Union address, carried live on Tuesday by nine national broadcast and cable networks, drew almost four million viewers more than President Bush's 2006 address (45.5 million, compared with 41.7 million). Despite the overall increase, the Fox News channel drew its smallest audience for a State of the Union by Mr. Bush, off nearly two million viewers from a year ago (4.6 million, compared with 6.5 million). Fox News's coverage remained first among cable channels, but No. 2 CNN saw a slight increase (to 2.4 million from 2.2 million) and No. 3 MSNBC's audience more than doubled, to 1.6 million viewers from 707,000.</p>
