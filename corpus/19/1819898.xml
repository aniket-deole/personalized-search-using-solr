        <p>Day Two of the ''American Idol'' premiere was just as dominant as the first, as the Wednesday edition garnered 36.9 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m., according to Nielsen's estimates. Declining just a half-million viewers from its record Tuesday start, the second night of ''Idol'' gave Fox one of its highest-rated Wednesdays ever. For the night, Fox once again trounced its competition, faring 79 percent better among adults 18 to 49 than NBC, ABC, CBS and CW combined. CBS was No. 2 for the night, as ''Criminal Minds'' at 9 (13.4 million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10 (13.7 million) drew solid audiences. CBS's ''Armed and Famous'' (6.1 million) finished third in the 8 p.m. hour, behind two episodes of ''According to Jim'' on ABC (6.9 million).</p>
