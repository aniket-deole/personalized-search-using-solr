        <p>The BBC said it might have to cut back on the creation of television shows and other programming after the government awarded it less public financing over the next six years than it had requested. The BBC's license fee, which every British household with a television is required to pay, will rise to £148 ($290) in 2012, from £131.50 last year. The fee will generate more than £20 billion ($39.4 billion) for the BBC over the six years, about £2 billion less than the BBC had requested, the broadcaster said. ''We now face not just a tight settlement but daunting investment challenges in distribution, infrastructure and technology that risk diverting money away from content creation,'' said Mark Thompson, above, the director general of the BBC.</p>
