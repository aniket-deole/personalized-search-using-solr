        <p>Ségolène Royal, the Socialist presidential candidate, suspended one of her two spokesmen for a month after he said she ''has only one flaw'': her longtime partner and the father of their four children, François Hollande, who is the leader of the Socialist Party. The aide, Arnaud Montebourg, made the comment on a television program on Wednesday evening. When the audience reacted with silence, he quickly added, ''It was a joke.'' Last week, Mr. Hollande suggested that taxes be raised for the middle class, an idea Ms. Royal promptly brushed aside. The new strains on her campaign came as her rival on the right, Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, outpaced her in two recent opinion polls.</p>
