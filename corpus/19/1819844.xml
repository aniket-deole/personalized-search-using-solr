        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''What $1.2 Trillion Can Buy'' (Business Day, Jan. 17):</p>
        <p>David Leonhardt's column about the opportunity costs of the Iraq war was long overdue, because it put those costs in perspective.</p>
        <p>This war is tragic when viewed through any lens, but it is especially so when one considers the diseases that could have been eradicated, the energy dilemmas resolved, the cities that could have been rebuilt, and the knowledge, culture and good will that could have been nurtured with a trillion dollars.</p>
        <p>Shock and awe indeed.</p>
        <p>Alan H. Fein  Key Biscayne, Fla., Jan. 17, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Leonhardt's column about what could have been done with the money spent on the Iraq war reminded me of a statement made by Dwight D. Eisenhower many years ago:</p>
        <p>''Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired represents, in the final analysis, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, who are cold and are not clothed.</p>
        <p>''This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is time the Republican leaders heeded the advice of one of their own.</p>
        <p>Carol Delaney  Providence, R.I., Jan. 17, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Kudos to David Leonhardt for pointing out the real cost of the war in Iraq. One cost he did not mention, however, is the cost to our reputation as a nation that adheres to the rule of law, respects human rights and promotes peace.</p>
