        <p>There is a great candor to Ellsworth Kelly's art, and always has been, as you can see in what amounts to a small survey of early and recent work at Matthew Marks's various Chelsea galleries. The largest, on West 22nd Street, has a half-dozen of the artist's new abstract relief paintings, made of superimposed geometric panels. They're like altarpiece diptychs with subtly mismatched halves that stack rather than fold.</p>

        <p>Matthew Marks Gallery  522 and 526 West 22nd Street; 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea  All through Jan. 27</p>
        <p>There is a great candor to Ellsworth Kelly's art, and always has been, as you can see in what amounts to a small survey of early and recent work at Matthew Marks's various Chelsea galleries. The largest, on West 22nd Street, has a half-dozen of the artist's new abstract relief paintings, made of superimposed geometric panels. They're like altarpiece diptychs with subtly mismatched halves that stack rather than fold.</p>
        <p>Each painting plays, in a straightforward way, with ideas that the artist, now 83, has been exploring for more than 60 years: the interrelationship, even interchangeability, of painting with sculpture; the creation of fictional objects in real space; the way abstraction can be its own kind of naturalism, intellectually demanding but utterly unesoteric, as plain and packed as a book.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Kelly's work is often associated with bright colors, these new pictures are in black and white. And that in itself has a long history in his career, as is demonstrated in a series of early works on paper in an adjoining gallery. Titled ''Drawings on a Bus -- Sketchbook 23, 1954,'' the series was done just after he had moved to New York, where he developed a form of abstraction inspired by the world around him.</p>
        <p>The landmark painting ''Cit√©'' (1951) is an example. It's like an image of light flickering on dark water, but translated into patterns of black-and-white bars. (The image is recaptured in a singe large print installed in Marks's window-only space on West 21st Street.)</p>
        <p>''Drawings on a Bus -- Sketchbook 23, 1954'' is what it says it is: a sequence of black ink sketches inspired by a changing shadow cast on a book the artist was reading on a bus ride. The main form starts as a small curve, then gradually swells; if you could look at the drawings flipbook-style, you'd see the black form expand to fill the white page. The sequence, drawn without guile or frills, is a record from nature and a fresh invention, from which the artist derived several black-and-white paintings.</p>
        <p>There are more, unstacked double-panel pieces in the West 24th Street space. Here color returns, not quite bright, not quite subdued, complicated but not all that complicated -- monumental the way a tall open window, a mature rose bush or a Shaker dresser is monumental. They aren't.</p>
