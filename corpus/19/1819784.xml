        <p>DIAMONDSTONE-Lawrence. It has been 2 yrs since you started your journey for another mill trip or a respite at your favorite secret harbor, AVI. These memories keep you alive to us. Although we miss seeing you, we remember you. Can you really be gone? Your advice and influence has left an indelible mark in our lives. You are free of pain and are resting in peace in a better place. Sincerely, The Feldman Family</p>
