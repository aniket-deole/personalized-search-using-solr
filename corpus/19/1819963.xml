        <p>8:30 P.M. (CMT) TRICK MY TRUCK After serving in Vietnam, Joseph Poole took to the roads as a trucker. Thirty-one years later, he has a dream: to take his Kenworth to urban areas and speak to teenagers about trucking as a noble profession that contributes to the country's prosperity.

Commander Henderson (Nick Frost) leads the force aboard the spacecraft H.M.S. Camden Lock as its members boldly go where no Englishmen have gone before.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) TRADING SPOUSES: MEET YOUR NEW MOMMY Marguerite Perrin, a k a God Warrior, who last season was made to look like Linda Blair in ''The Exorcist'' as she preached her heated brand of Christianity, comes back for another swap -- this time with a politically conscious African-American mother in Florida. Ms. Perrin has made some changes since last year, including a 94-pound weight loss: she used the $50,000 from her first appearance, money she originally called tainted, for gastric-bypass surgery. But has her attitude been adjusted?</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) WHAT NOT TO WEAR: MADE IN MANHATTAN Sherily Toledo, a 31-year-old single mother, routinely dresses herself in hand-me-downs. Tonight, Stacy and Clinton whisk Ms. Toledo away to a dress designer for a couture gown made to her specifications.</p>

        <p>10 P.M. (Showtime) THE BLACK CAT Once upon a midnight dreary, in this latest ''Masters of Horror'' installment, Edgar Allan Poe (Jeffrey Combs) pondered his writing, lately so weak and weary. And then a cat came a tapping, gently rapping, rapping at his chamber door. Well, whatever you do, don't answer it!</p>
