        <p>This Chicago artist's collage drawings are as intricate as Byzantine mosaics. Surrealist in style, each has the violently pretty look of a tattoo. Mr. Fitzpatrick makes the works by drawing in the core elements and then incorporates collage material cut from old-fashioned magazines, ticket stubs, matchbooks and assorted memorabilia that he has scavenged from junk and dime stores. Every piece has a story to tell, sometimes real, sometimes made up. (Left, ''Devil Baby,'' 2006.) The stories often involve prostitutes, scoundrels and gamblers, suggesting more of an accent on evil, immoral or degrading practices and habits than in previous collages. The two dozen works here are the latest chapter in his larger ongoing series ''The Wonder: A Portrait of Chicago.'' Some of the women depicted in these collages are in their underwear, while others wear nothing. The result resembles a cross between Indian miniature painting and a swimsuit catalog. Several other collages are dominated by a shadowy, central ace of spades. These are tributes to his father, a burial-vault salesman known to friends as Ace. Here at last some of the pain at the core of his art comes into focus. (Through Feb. 5, Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-599-2144, pierogi2000.com.)</p>
