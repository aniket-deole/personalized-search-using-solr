        <p>For Children</p>
        <p>'ADVENTURES FROM EZRA JACK KEATS: APT. 3 AND MAGGIE AND THE PIRATE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Two books by this author and illustrator come to life onstage in the winter musical from Tada!, the youth theater troupe. ''Apt. 3'' focuses on the friendship two children forge with a blind neighbor; ''Maggie and the Pirate'' is about, well, a girl and a pirate (a small, friendly one). (Through Feb. 11.) At 2 and 4 p.m., Tada!, 15 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 252-1619 ; tadatheater.com; $18; $8 for ages 17 and under.</p>
        <p>TOM CHAPIN (Sunday) A performer with roots in the folk tradition, Mr. Chapin has also been a pioneer in children's music. At this concert he will offer old favorites and songs from his most recent album, ''Some Assembly Required,'' whose title will resonate with many parents. At 2 p.m., Colden Auditorium, Kupferberg Center for the Arts, Queens College, Kissena Boulevard and the Long Island Expressway, Flushing, Queens, (718) 793-8080, kupferbergcenter.org; $12.</p>
        <p>CROSS-GENERATION CHESS (Sunday) The chessboard is common ground in this monthly program that brings together children from kindergarten through high school with elderly adults. Interested chess players -- of any level -- meet for games, live classical music, light refreshments and, most important, conversation. From 9 a.m. to noon, the Marshall Chess Club, 23 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village. Free. Registration: (917) 822-3141.</p>
        <p>CYBERCHASE: MY BIG IDEA DAY (Tomorrow) There aren't many cartoons that teach math, but ''Cyberchase,'' on PBS, is one. The New York Hall of Science is celebrating the show with screenings of invention-theme episodes and related activities. From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005, nyhallsci.org. Free with admission: $11; $8 for college students and ages 2 to 17 and 62+.</p>
        <p>'HENRY AND MUDGE' (Today through Sunday) This Theatreworks/USA musical is inspired by Cynthia Rylant's best-selling books about a boy (Henry) and his best friend (Mudge), 182 pounds of fur, slobber and affection. Today and tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 4 p.m., Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; $25.</p>
        <p>'JANE EYRE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In Polly Teale's unusual adaptation of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s 1847 classic, Mr. Rochester's mad wife is also the embodiment of Jane's repressed rage and desire. For middle and high school students, this may be a new avenue into the book. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 760-0064, queenstheatre.org; $34; $32 for 65+ and $20 for students.</p>
        <p>KIDS' BOOK CLUB: GIRLS READ! (Sunday) This is a new venture for ages 9 to 12, and yes, there will be equal time for boys: next month Guys Read! has its debut. Presented by Symphony Space and the Bank Street Bookstore, the program invites favorite writers for discussions and readings. In this inaugural event the author Gail Carson Levine will share her ideas, and the actress Cynthia Nixon will read from Ms. Levine's new book, ''Fairest,'' a retelling of ''Snow White.'' At 1 p.m., the Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $15 and $18; $10 and $13 for children; $6 for Just Kidding Club members.</p>
        <p>'THE LIFE AND WORK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER'  A bean may not seem very intriguing on a child's plate, but offer it under a microscope, and this lowly legume becomes exciting. That's just one of the learning opportunities presented by this program at the New York Botanical Garden, which celebrates Carver (1864-1943), a pioneering African-American botanist. (Through Feb. 11.) At the Bendheim Global Greenhouse, the Everett Children's Adventure Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx; (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. Tuesdays through Fridays, 1:30 to 4:30; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Combination tickets (includes the grounds, the children's garden and other displays): $13; ages 62+ and students, $11; 2 to 12, $5; free for under 2.</p>
        <p>THE LITTLE ORCHESTRA SOCIETY (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''Do You Hear What I Hear?'' is the title of the orchestra's latest Lolli-Pops concert, intended, like the series's namesake, to be a sweet treat. The Lolli-Pops events, geared to ages 3 to 5, use the friendly characters Bang, Bow, Buzz and Toot to introduce musical principles: in this case, high and low, soft and loud and fast and slow. Tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. and noon, Sunday at 1 and 2:30 p.m., the Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 971-9500, littleorchestra.org; $40.</p>
        <p>THE MERMAID THEATER (Tomorrow) This Canadian troupe will offer a production that is a combined adaptation of three picture books by Leo Lionni: ''Swimmy,'' ''Frederick'' and ''Inch by Inch.'' Their heroes -- a fish, a mouse and an inchworm -- are all, in their way, innovative thinkers. At 11 a.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $14 to $25; $13 for children; $8 for Just Kidding Club members.</p>
        <p>THE 92ND STREET Y (Sunday) Turning trash into treasure -- or at least something useful -- is the theme of two programs at the Y. At 10 a.m. ''Recycling -- Pollution Solution,'' the latest in the Sunday Science Spectacular Series, teaches about conservation and helps participants make a recycled item. Fee: $40; $20 for children. At 3 p.m. ''Bash the Trash 'n' Brass,'' a concert for ages 3 to 6, enlists the audience in exploring brass instruments and constructing new ones from castoff materials. $10. At 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; 92y.org.</p>
        <p>PERCUSSION PEOPLE (Sunday) Instrument building is also on the menu at the interactive monthly concerts presented by this group, which explores the range of percussion instruments across cultures. Young drumming enthusiasts (and what child isn't one?) are encouraged to arrive at 10:30 and make their own instruments for a concert at 11. At the Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101; $15.</p>
        <p>'PINKALICIOUS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Sometimes being in the pink can be too much of a good thing, as the pink-obsessed title character finds out in this new musical from Vital Children's Theater, which Elizabeth and Victoria Kann adapted from their book. (John Gregor wrote the score and some of the lyrics.) Tomorrow and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212) 352-3101; $18.</p>
        <p>'A SHELTER IN OUR CAR' (Monday through next Friday) Reggae, jazz and hip-hop infuse the score of this musical adaptation of Monica Gunning's award-winning book about a Jamaican girl, Hettie, who becomes homeless when her father dies not long after the family has emigrated to the United States. A world premiere from Making Books Sing, an organization devoted to turning children's literature into theater. (Through Feb. 13.) At 10:30 a.m., Lovinger Theater at Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (212) 573-8791, Ext. 246; $8 to $25.</p>
        <p>'THE THREE LITTLE PIGS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Will the Big Bad Wolf ever learn good manners? Will two of that trio of pigs ever master proper construction techniques? Fans of the tale can find out in this new musical adaptation by Manhattan Children's Theater. (Through Feb. 25.)At noon and 2 p.m., 52 White Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; $15.</p>
        <p>TOXIC AUDIO (Tomorrow and Sunday) Toxic? How about tonic? There's nothing harmful in the sounds of this inventive group, which combines a cappella singing with improv comedy and a variety of vocal gymnastics. Tomorrow at 2:30 and 9 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m., New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; $34.95.</p>
        <p>WAVE HILL (Tomorrow and Sunday) Investigate desert dwellers -- the plant variety -- in a family art project of sketching and painting tomorrow and Sunday at 1 p.m. at this garden in the Bronx. Free. Independence Avenue and West 249th Street, Riverdale, (718) 549-3200, wavehill.org.</p>
