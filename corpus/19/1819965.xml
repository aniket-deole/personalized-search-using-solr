        <p>A South Ozone Park man was convicted yesterday of robbing a man inside a crack house in Jamaica and shooting the man's stepson to death during a subsequent confrontation, prosecutors said. The man, Timmy Lee Walker, 33, was convicted of murder, kidnapping and robbery in State Supreme Court, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said Mr. Walker robbed James Hubbard, 48, at gunpoint on Sept. 5, 2004, while the men were in the crack house on 140th Street. About an hour later, Mr. Hubbard; his stepson, Tony Brunson, 22; and another man rushed into the house, and Mr. Walker shot Mr. Brunson to death, Mr. Brown said. The other two men subdued him until the police arrived, he said. Mr. Walker faces up to 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on Feb. 8.</p>
