        <p>Correction of Jan 11 obituary about James C Weeks, former president of The New York Times Regional Media Group; he was graduate of Harvard Business School and earned undergraduate degree from University of Florida; his widow is Toney Weeks</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An obituary on Jan. 11 by The New York Times Regional Newspapers about James C. Weeks, a former president and chief operating officer of The New York Times Regional Media Group, incorrectly described his postgraduate education. He was a graduate of the Program for Management Development at the Harvard Business School -- not a recipient of a master's degree in marketing from the University of Florida, where he earned his undergraduate degree. The obituary also misspelled the given name of his wife. She is Toney Weeks, not Toni.</p>
