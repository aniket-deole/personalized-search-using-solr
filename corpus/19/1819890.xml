        <p>Only weeks after closing its deal for BellSouth, AT&amp;T is embarking on an ambitious strategy to show customers the benefit of its owning 100 million phone lines.</p>
        <p>In an announcement expected Friday, AT&amp;T will introduce AT&amp;T Unity, a pricing package that allows its cellular customers to call any AT&amp;T landline customer without incurring additional usage fees or using their wireless minutes. While AT&amp;T wireless customers can already call each other free, the new plan will extend the program on a large scale to landline customers, enlarging what AT&amp;T likes to call its ''community.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's a very significant development,'' said Mark A. Winther, a telecommunications analyst with IDC, a technology consulting firm. ''It's taking the emphasis away from price and putting it on the value of being part of the community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Winther said the package would probably appeal to high-volume customers, both in the consumer market and in small businesses, not to the shopper looking for the lowest monthly rate. The plans apply only to AT&amp;T wireless packages starting at $59.99 for 900 anytime minutes a month.</p>
        <p>To subscribe to a AT&amp;T Unity plan, a customer would need to have AT&amp;T wireless service as well as a landline plan that offered unlimited local and long-distance service. AT&amp;T's unlimited local and long-distance landline service starts at $40 a month if bought online.</p>
        <p>The pricing plan comes weeks after AT&amp;T closed its $85.8 billion acquisition of BellSouth, the largest telecommunications merger in history. With the merger, AT&amp;T became the sole owner of Cingular Wireless, and on Monday the company dropped the Cingular brand in favor of the AT&amp;T name. AT&amp;T previously owned 60 percent of Cingular, and BellSouth owned 40 percent. The combined company offers wireless and landline service in 22 states.</p>
        <p>''This is the first of many products that are going to come out of the AT&amp;T-BellSouth merger,'' said Ralph de la Vega, group president of regional wireline operations for AT&amp;T, of San Antonio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winther said other carriers would probably try to respond with new bundling options, but that AT&amp;T would have an advantage because of its large coverage area.</p>
        <p>Other wireless carriers, like T-Mobile with its myFaves option, already allow customers to call landline numbers free, but those are typically restricted to a handful of designated numbers. AT&amp;T's strategy is a logical step in telecommunications marketing, Mr. Winther said, following on the popularity of bundled packages that combine phone, broadband and cable services on one bill.</p>
