        <p>HITCHENS--Robert C., former Vice President of SIN Television, died on December 30, 2006 at age 85. A resident of Seaford, NY, he is survived by his wife, Margaret Sayward Hitchens, daughter, Patricia J. Hitchens-Bonow, and grandsons Robert H. Bonow and Samuel C. Bonow. A Naval aviation navigator in World War II, in 1946 he received a University of Missouri journalism degree, followed by a notable career in broadcast marketing. As Director of Sales at NBC Radio Network, he helped convince Madison Avenue that radio could thrive despite the advent of television. During 22 years at SIN, he opened the eyes of television advertisers to the Hispanic market, in the process becoming a broadcast industry guru.
