        <p>A police officer was injured last night in a hit-and-run involving a sport utility vehicle that he had stopped in Jamaica, the police said. The S.U.V., a black GMC Yukon, dragged the officer 30 feet to 122nd Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard about 8:30 p.m., they said. It then fled north on Sutphin Boulevard. The vehicle was found abandoned about an hour later on 139th Street. The officer, Sgt. John Pagnotta, 40, was in stable condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, the police said. Investigators said that they had identified the vehicle's owner and were looking to question him.</p>
