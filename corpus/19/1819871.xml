        <p>Los Angeles officials are joined by FBI director Robert S Mueller III in vowing to dismantle Latino gang known as 204th Street, which has been accused of racially motivated violence, including shooting death of Cheryl Green, 14-year-old black girl, in December; Mueller photo (M)</p>

        <p>The authorities said Thursday that they would dismantle a Latino gang that has been accused of racially motivated violence, including the shooting death last month of a 14-year-old black girl.</p>

        <p>The authorities said Thursday that they would dismantle a Latino gang that has been accused of racially motivated violence, including the shooting death last month of a 14-year-old black girl.</p>
        <p>The announcement was made in the heart of the gang's territory, in the Harbor Gateway neighborhood, by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa; Chief William Bratton of the Los Angeles police; the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert S. Mueller III; and city and county prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Two members of the gang, known as 204th Street, have been charged with murder in the death of the girl, Cheryl Green, who was shot as she talked with friends near an unofficial boundary separating blacks and Latinos.</p>
        <p>The district attorney has submitted a filing that the killing, part of years of tension in the neighborhood, was motivated by hate, making the defendants eligible for the death penalty.</p>
        <p>The killing has raised concern about racial strife among gangs elsewhere in the city, though the Harbor Gateway problem has been called particularly serious because of Cheryl's killing.</p>
        <p>The crackdown is to include an infusion of police officers and federal agents to step up electronic surveillance of the gang and make arrests even for relatively mundane infractions like curfew violations, truancy and trespassing.</p>
        <p>The city attorney will seek an injunction barring gang members from congregating at certain places and times, a tactic that the police say has proved successful in other areas.</p>
        <p>Gang crackdowns have in the past yielded mixed results at best. Typically, the violence subsides until the police pull back as pressure to patrol other areas increases.</p>
        <p>''It's like a ship passing in water,'' said Wes McBride, executive director of the California Gang Investigators Association. ''As soon as the ship passes, the wake fills in. It's too manpower intensive.''</p>
