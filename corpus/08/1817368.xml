        <p>Test subjects watching ''Love Story,'' the lachrymose 1970 romance, ate on average almost 125 grams of buttered, salty popcorn (the amount found in a medium-size bag at the movies) -- about 28 percent more than did those watching ''Sweet Home Alabama,'' the 2002 fish-out-of-water comedy about a fashion designer going home to the rural South. The experiment, which involved 30 subjects watching each film over two days, was described in a paper in the January issue of the Journal of Marketing about the connection between people's moods and the type and quantity of food they eat. The studies found that compared with happy people, people who are feeling unhappy eat larger amounts of foods they consider tasty, but unhealthy.</p>
        <p>In another study described in the same paper, college students reading about the deaths of seven children in a fire ate more than four times as many M&amp;M's as raisins from nearby bowls of snacks. The effect was opposite among subjects reading about four old friends having an evening together after a chance reunion.</p>

        <p>''When people are sad, they have this need to seek a reward, and it's very easy to pick up on unhealthy, but tasty, food,'' said Nitika Garg, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Mississippi and one of the paper's three authors.</p>
