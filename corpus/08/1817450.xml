        <p>''I hope he understands that it's business, not personal,'' said Senator John J. Bonacic, a Hudson Valley Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonacic was referring to his vocal opposition to the re-election of the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, as temporary president of the Senate, after the revelation that Mr. Bruno's outside consulting work is the subject of a federal investigation. Last week, Mr. Bonacic walked out of the Senate chamber rather than cast the only vote against Mr. Bruno, the state's most powerful Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonacic said Mr. Bruno had done nothing to make him feel unwelcome since then. ''That's behind us now,'' said Mr. Bonacic, who joked that both his kneecaps and his supply of office materials remained intact.</p>
        <p>Still, he cautioned, in politics, people never forget.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to see how we are treated as we go forward,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He mused for a few moments, and then mentioned the recent defection of Mr. Balboni, left, which left Republicans with a slimmer 33-28 majority.</p>
        <p>''The truth of the matter is, Senator Balboni went with Eliot Spitzer,'' and not against Mr. Bruno, Mr. Bonacic said, explaining why the Bruno forces were unlikely to retaliate.</p>
        <p>''We need each other, for the strength of the conference,'' Mr. Bonacic added. ''This is not the time for bloodshed.''</p>
