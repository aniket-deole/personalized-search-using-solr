        <p>Islamists Out, Somalia Tries to Rise From Chaos</p>
        <p>In just two weeks, Somalia's political world has been turned upside down, with the militant Islamist forces that ruled much of the nation for the past six months driven out by Ethiopian troops. But dire needs remain in the dusty, chaotic, forlorn wrecks of its cities: food, water, shelter, fire protection, law, order -- and hope.</p>

        <p>Harvard May Choose A Woman as President</p>
        <p>The search to replace Lawrence H. Summers, who resigned as president of Harvard last February amid fierce faculty discontent, is secretive, but the list of candidates includes three women who are Ivy League presidents.</p>

        <p>Eagles and Patriots Make It A Bad Day for New York</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots made sure the Giants and the Jets had short stays in the N.F.L. playoffs.</p>
        <p>The Eagles beat the visiting Giants, 23-20, on a 38-yard field goal as time expired in what was expected to be the final game for the Giants star Tiki Barber, above. Philadelphia will play at New Orleans on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Patriots took advantage of a Jets fumble and an interception to win, 37-16, as Tom Brady threw for two touchdowns. Sunday, in the second round, New England will face San Diego.</p>
