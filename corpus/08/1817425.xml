        <p>General Electric agreed yesterday to acquire the oil and gas operations from Vetco International for $1.9 billion, people familiar with the situation said yesterday. The deal, which is expected to be announced today, is part of G.E.'s efforts to grow its energy business as the industry continues its boom.</p>
        <p>G.E. will be acquiring the oil and gas operations, called Vetco Gray, from a consortium of private equity firms that includes Candover, 3i and JPMorgan Partners. Vetco Gray makes drilling and production equipment as well as systems used to extract oil and gas from beneath the ocean.</p>
        <p>Vetco Gray is expected to be merged into G.E.'s infrastructure unit, which had $41.8 billion in sales in 2005. G.E.'s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, has been outspoken about his intention to increase his company's share of the market to service the energy industry. The deal with Vetco is the first part of a long-range plan to increase the exposure of G.E.'s infrastructure unit, which also includes turbines, to the energy world</p>
        <p>The private equity consortium was represented by Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company.</p>
