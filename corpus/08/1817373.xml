        <p>The Taliban appeared to be resuming their campaign of violence after a week of quiet over the Islamic festival of Id al-Adha.</p>
        <p>Two newborn babies, their mother and a grandmother were killed in a roadside bombing in eastern Afghanistan as they were returning home from the hospital on Sunday, said the provincial police chief of Khost, Muhammad Ayub, who called the attack ''inhuman.'' Three others in the car, a woman and two men, were wounded, he said.</p>
        <p>In a separate attack, gunmen on a motorcycle killed a high school headmaster in the southern province of Helmand as he was walking home from morning prayers at his local mosque, according to an Interior Ministry spokesman.</p>
        <p>American soldiers thwarted a suicide car-bomb attack on their outpost in the eastern province of Paktika on Saturday. The troops began shooting at the advancing vehicle, and it crashed into an outside barrier and exploded, according to a NATO statement. Five soldiers were wounded, and the bomber was killed.</p>
        <p>A NATO soldier was also wounded in a roadside explosion in Kandahar Province on Saturday, a NATO spokesman said.</p>
        <p>More than 600 civilians have been killed in the past three years, including those killed as a result of operations by NATO, American and Afghan troops as well as attacks by the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission reported Sunday. The commission appealed for the military to take more care to avoid civilian casualties and called for compensation to be given to the victims' families.</p>
