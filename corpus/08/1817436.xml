        <p>Animal Collective</p>
        <p>''People'' (FatCat)</p>
        <p>In their own cryptic, low-key way, the members of Animal Collective have had a triumphant few years. In 2005 they released a glorious album called ''Feels''; its flickering experiments and lightheaded love songs (were they love songs?) unfolded without ever quite giving up their secrets. The album eventually sold about 40,000 copies in the United States; that's an impressive number for a band like this. And late last year Animal Collective signed with Domino Records, one of the country's leading indie-rock labels.</p>

        <p>Maybe that's why this little CD sounds so exuberant. ''People,'' the new Animal Collective mini-album, was available for sale on the band's recent tour, and some stores have been selling an import version; now FatCat is issuing a domestic pressing. The disc, which lasts about 19 minutes, is dominated by two versions of the title track. The studio version, a typically lush and detailed outtake from the ''Feels'' sessions, uses a simple bass line and a simpler lyric (''Yeah, ye-ah'') to build up momentum; eventually it explodes into a scream: ''People! People!'' And in the live version, you can hear some of those people screaming back.</p>
