        <p>The Maryland Lottery awarded Trahan, Burden &amp; Charles, Baltimore, a contract to serve as interim agency of record for six to eight months. The decision came after an emergency review prompted by the unexpected closing last month of Eisner Communications, Baltimore, which had handled the account since 2001. The lottery is expected to spend an estimated $8 million to $10 million during the term of the contract.</p>
        <p>Godiva Chocolatier, part of Campbell Soup, Camden, N.J., selected Sugartown Creative, New York, to handle its worldwide creative account, which had been handled by Margeotes Fertitta Powell, New York, and predecessor agencies for more than two decades. Spending was estimated at $12 million. Margeotes Fertitta, part of MDC Partners, did not take part in a review for the assignment.</p>
        <p>Method Products, San Francisco, which sells household cleaners, chose the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, to handle its account after parting ways last month with Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky, Miami, a unit of MDC Partners. Spending was estimated at $3 million.</p>
