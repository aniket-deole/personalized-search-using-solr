        <p>Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, is using the Consumer Electronics Show here to highlight several new consumer-oriented products and to unveil a partnership with the Ford Motor Company to build Microsoft technology into several Ford models.</p>
        <p>The show, the largest trade event in North America, has become an annual forum for Mr. Gates to mix product announcements with computer-filled visions of future Microsoft-based technologies.</p>
        <p>In remarks prepared for delivery on Sunday night, the eve of the show, he sought to differentiate Microsoft from other companies by showing how its software products tie together a range of consumer activities including games, interactive television, communications and music. A Microsoft executive briefed reporters on the presentation on Friday.</p>
        <p>Among the announcements was the introduction of a hardware upgrade to the Xbox 360 video-game system that will permit the system to deliver the Microsoft interactive television service being offered by partners, including AT&amp;T. The system will duplicate many capabilities of the Media Center version of the Windows operating system, like the ability to record and play back digital video.</p>
        <p>Microsoft and Ford are to offer a system called Sync, a voice-activated method for connecting cellphones and media players -- like Microsoft's Zune -- to a vehicle. Similar systems are widely available in Japanese and German automobiles. Sync, the first major commercial introduction of the Microsoft Auto software, offers hands-free phone dialing and can read incoming text messages through the car's audio system.</p>
        <p>Microsoft is also introducing a consumer software product called Windows Home Server that will be marketed with several partners, including Hewlett-Packard. It will be an appliancelike device that will connect to a home network and perform functions like network-based backup and media and file-sharing as well as functioning as a Web server. The price will be between $400 and $500, according to Microsoft executives. The product will be based on Windows Server 2003, and not the company's newer Windows Vista operating system.</p>
        <p>On the program with Mr. Gates was Robbie Bach, the executive in charge of the company's consumer products, to demonstrate game play involving a PC user running Windows Vista competing against a home user playing the game on an Xbox 360. There is no public timetable for such a capability, a company executive said, adding that the feature would not be available for all of the Xbox 360 games.</p>
        <p>Another scheduled demonstration involved the current version of the Home of the Future, an installation at Microsoft headquarters with prototypes of home-oriented technologies. Applications chosen for the spotlight were radio-frequency ID tags and displays for the walls of children's bedrooms using organic light-emitting diodes.</p>
