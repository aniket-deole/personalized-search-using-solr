        <p>An investigation is under way into what caused a metal plate weighing thousands of pounds to fall and crush a worker to death on Saturday morning at the GMD Shipyard in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a spokesman for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said yesterday. ''We are conducting an investigation to determine whether any safety standards were violated,'' said Ted Fitzgerald, the spokesman. The worker, Christopher G. Thomas, above, was killed after being crushed by the plate, which was being used to repair a barge in dry dock. Mr. Thomas was working beneath the barge when the plate came loose and crashed to the ground. His sister-in-law, Kathy McLean, 45, said yesterday that family members planned to meet with officials from GMD today.</p>
