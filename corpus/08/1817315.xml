        <p>GINGOLD--Muriel (nee Holler), passed away peacefully Saturday evening at the age of 85 years old. She was an angel right here on earth. She was very cheritable, kind and always willing to help, and particularly compassioate and understanding. She absolutely and unconditionally loved all of her family and legion of loving friends, especially her childhood sweetheart, her deceased husband, Bob. Her brother Bob and Sister Evelyn, her four adoring and greatful children Michael, Carol, Gary, Bobby and thier spouses Maggie, John and Ellis. Seven gradchildren and four great-grandchilren. Muriel so much loved life, God, country, and ALL people. She loved to sing, dance, play the piano and had an amazig sense of humor. At family and other functions, she would be always asked to sing, and after much coaxing, she would give in. Well, she would tear the house down. She was totally unpretentious and had a natural talent, and charisma second to none. Muriel liked to talk about a song she wanted to write-she never quite finished it. She called it 'Put Another Star in the American Flag Only Shape it Like a Heart'. That was mom. She will now become the legend she was to the thousands of us who shared her lIfe. God bless her. Her wake is going to be at The Dalton Funeral Home at 125 Hillside Ave, New Hide Park NY, 11040. 516-354-0634. The wake will be Monday January 8th, from 7-9:30pm, and Tuesday January 9, from 2-5pm, and in the evening from 7-9:30pm. Funeral Mass, Wendnesday, January 10, at St. Gregory's the Great Church at 9:45am. 242-20 88th Ave, Bellerose NY, 11426. Following services, funeral procession will proceed to Calverton Cemetary, Long Island, NY, for burial.</p>
