        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Wisconsin City's Revival of Downtown Has a Downside'' (news article, Jan. 1):</p>
        <p>Our national research involving 120 colleges in 40 states has shown that the greater the number of alcohol outlets near colleges, the higher the rate of student binge drinking, and the higher the rate of secondhand effects in neighborhoods surrounding the college.</p>
        <p>These effects include noise, vandalism, assaults, littering and other activities that degrade neighborhood life. A high density of bars and liquor stores leads to more competition for customers, lower prices and special promotions such as ''ladies' night'' or ''all you can drink for a set price,'' and supersized drinks.</p>
        <p>We have found that these forms of marketing are associated with higher rates of binge drinking. You get what you pay for.</p>
        <p>If a town wants to allow this type of situation in its downtown area, it should be prepared to spend more for policing, emergency medical care, and cleanup and repair.</p>
        <p>Henry Wechsler  Boston, Jan. 1, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is the former director of the College Alcohol Study at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
