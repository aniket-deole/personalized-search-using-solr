        <p>Women were initially deemed unfit for rigors of higher education but now make up 58 percent of college enrollment; charts illustrate path of coeducation and growth over years (special section, Education Life) (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the beginning, American universities admitted men only. Women were deemed unfit for the rigors of higher education -- insufficient blood to the brain, you know -- and in need of teaching more suited to their jobs as mothers and wives. The rest is history. Today, women make up 58 percent of college enrollment. Their numbers started growing in the 1980s, though men still rule at the most elite institutions. The colleges and universities below, single sex at their founding, illustrate the path of coeducation. It's a fuzzy path. A graduate school might have admitted women almost 100 years before the undergraduate program did. More recently, women's colleges have been opening their doors to the opposite sex.</p>
        <p>As for that mainstay of the old-boy network, fraternities, they thrive sporadically. Of the institutions below, Washington &amp; Lee University rules, followed by DePauw and Sewanee: University of the South.</p>
