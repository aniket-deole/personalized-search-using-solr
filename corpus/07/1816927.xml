        <p>One of the most intriguing programs in the wide-ranging DANCE ON CAMERA festival, at 10 theaters and galleries in Manhattan and Brooklyn through Jan. 14, takes place Sunday at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. Dance played an important role in early film, forcing the medium to come to terms with capturing movement. By the 1940s prominent avant-garde filmmakers were being drawn to the challenge of using movement as material, among them Kenneth Anger, Bruce Conner, Ed Emshwiller and Jonas Mekas. They are among the 11 filmmakers chosen by Robert Haller, director of collections at Anthology Film Archives, for ''American Cinedance Pioneers: Moving Bodies After Maya Deren,'' to be screened Sunday at 4:30 p.m. 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; (212) 727-0764 or dancefilms.org.</p>
        <p>A screen presence, TAYE DIGGS, is emerging as a modern-dance choreographer, with a new work to be performed by the COMPLEXIONS CONTEMPORARY BALLET in a season at the Joyce Theater that opens on Tuesday. He trained with Garth Fagan and others in his native Rochester and with Desmond Richardson and Dwight Rhoden, the founders of the Complexions, in Manhattan. Mr. Richardson will dance Mr. Diggs's ''Loose Change,'' in programs that also include pieces by Mr. Rhoden and Jodie Gates. 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 42-0800 or joyce.org; $42, Joyce members, $32.</p>
        <p>The MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP will celebrate the new year -- and itself -- with 17 days of performances, discussions and other events, beginning Wednesday (mmdg.org). Mr. Morris is as witty and ebullient a speaker as he is a choreographer, and he will have the chance to show that in two interviews. Joan Acocella of The New Yorker will talk with Mr. Morris on Saturday as part of the Dance on Camera Festival at Lincoln Center, and Robert Greskovic of The Wall Street Journal will interview him on Jan. 16 at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.</p>
