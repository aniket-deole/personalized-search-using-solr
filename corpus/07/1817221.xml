        <p>Democrats' Medicare Drug Plan May Lack Leverage  Democrats want to negotiate lower Medicare drug prices and say the government should not decide which drugs are covered. But many experts say the way to get big savings is to steer patients to preferred drugs.</p>
        <p>PAGE 17</p>
        <p>Super Bowl Hopes Slip Away  The first day of the N.F.L. playoffs ended with a wild finish, as Dallas botched the snap on a potentially game-winning field-goal attempt and lost, 21-20, at Seattle. In yesterday's other game, Indianapolis defeated Kansas City, 23-8.</p>
        <p>SPORTSSUNDAY</p>
        <p>Reversal on Baby Prize  Toys ''R'' Us reversed its decision and awarded $25,000 savings bonds to three babies born on New Year's Day, including one whose parents are not legal residents.</p>
        <p>PAGE 23</p>
        <p>Big Sur's Quiet Season  When summer's crowds are gone, and the RV caravans are a distant memory, nature reasserts itself along this ruggedly beautiful stretch of California coastline.</p>
        <p>TRAVEL</p>
        <p>Somalis Riot Over Disarming  Hundreds of Somalis stormed into the streets to hurl rocks at Ethiopian troops allied with the government and to chant antigovernment slogans, even as a deadline to surrender all weapons was postponed.</p>
        <p>PAGE 3</p>
        <p>SPECIAL TODAY</p>
        <p>The Oscars  A special section on the Academy Award candidates, including a profile of Kate Winslet and a look at how Clint Eastwood upended the entire contest.</p>
        <p>ARTS &amp; LEISURE</p>
        <p>Education Life  The number of Asian undergraduates at elite colleges -- more than 41 percent at the University of California, Berkeley -- is a new element in the affirmative action debate. Some say there are too many; others, not enough. Also: When high school is harder than college, what happens when you actually get to college?</p>
