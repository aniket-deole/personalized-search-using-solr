        <p>Introduced on Sunday: Lincoln MKR design study</p>
        <p>Is it real?: This car isn't, but its design themes and powertrains are</p>
        <p>destined for future Lincolns.</p>
        <p>What's the point? Lincoln has fallen desperately behind the luxury leaders,</p>
        <p>and this dramatic chrome-face concept shows Lincoln reasserting its American roots.</p>
        <p>What they said: ''We're referring to the past without repeating it,'' Peter Horbury, Ford's director of design for the Americas, said.</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: In following the lead of the Mercedes-Benz CLS by styling a four-door sedan to look like a sexy coupe, Lincoln is also distancing itself from retro designs that lacked new ideas.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? Behind its grinning mug -- a nod to the '41 Lincoln Continental Cabriolet -- there's a 415-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 with direct fuel injection and two turbochargers. The engine is E85 ethanol-ready, and Ford claims better fuel economy than a comparably powerful V-8.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon?: The engine is part of a new ''TwinForce'' family that should begin powering Ford and Lincoln models by about 2009.</p>
        <p>How's it look?: A shot of design adrenaline that -- if actually administered</p>
        <p>to showroom models -- could wake Lincoln from its long coma.</p>
