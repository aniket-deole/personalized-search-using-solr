        <p>Rick PERLSTEIN, who reviews Chris Hedges' book ''American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War on America'' on Page 15, is not a man of the right, but a dozen years ago he became interested in writing about conservatism. ''The 1994 off-year election -- the one dominated by Newt Gingrich's conservative revolutionaries -- awakened a burning fascination in me,'' Perlstein said in an e-mail message. ''How was it that so many of my fellow citizens were taking things for granted that were absolutely the opposite of what I then took for granted? It's part of the fascination of belonging to such a big, complex country like America: we're all surrounded by people who are utterly exotic to us, and us to them.''</p>
        <p>Perlstein went on to write ''Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus'' (2001), which described the birth pangs of the modern right. He has also contributed articles to publications like The Nation and The New Republic, and ''just finished the manuscript for a big book I've worked on for five years. It's called 'Nixonland: The Politics and Culture of the American Berserk, 1965-1972,' and it's about Richard Nixon's rise to power,'' set against ''the background of the social cataclysms of the 1960s.''</p>
