        <p>As Mr. Nardelli found out, chief executives don't have to lift a company's stock price to leave with a nice, fat severance package.</p>
        <p>Consider Fabian Mansson, the chief executive of Eddie Bauer since 2003. After the company exited bankruptcy in the summer of 2005, its stock was trading above $30. But the company lost almost $300 million in the first three quarters of 2006, so the stock is now trading around $9.</p>

        <p>Consider Fabian Mansson, the chief executive of Eddie Bauer since 2003. After the company exited bankruptcy in the summer of 2005, its stock was trading above $30. But the company lost almost $300 million in the first three quarters of 2006, so the stock is now trading around $9.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Mansson leaves Eddie Bauer, which became more likely when the company agreed in November to be acquired by two buyout firms, he will be in a position to receive at least $10 million in severance benefits.</p>
        <p>Eddie Bauer will also buy him a new home in his native Sweden, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
