        <p>Three former North Rockland High School students have been arrested and charged with stealing statues of the baby Jesus from nativity scenes the last two years.</p>
        <p>The robbers struck twice in Suffern and four times in Haverstraw last month and, according to the police, left notes saying, ''Jesus never graduated from high school'' and signed ''The Opiates.''</p>
        <p>The former students were identified as Stephen J. Hitchings, 20, of Stony Point; Paul J. McAllister, 18, of Garnerville; and Nina Zain, 20, of Haverstraw. Each has been charged with 14 counts of petty larceny. The charges include similar thefts in Haverstraw in 2005.</p>
        <p>''They turned out to be three very contrite kids,'' said Detective Craig H. Long, a spokesman for the Suffern Police Department.</p>
        <p>The notes led the police to discover two figurines beneath the sign at Suffern High School on Dec. 26. The next day, four more statues were found under the sign at North Rockland High School. School tapes at North Rockland and a watchful neighbor who got a description of a car and a license plate number helped lead to the arrests, the police said.</p>
        <p>While there was speculation that the thefts could be a hate crime, the police said the suspects told them they had stolen the statues for kicks because they were bored.</p>
        <p>''They say the Opiates as a name doesn't mean anything,'' Lt. John Campbell, a spokesman for the Haverstraw police, said. ''It was just a catchy name.''</p>
