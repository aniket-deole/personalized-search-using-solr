        <p>As he was about to travel 1,800 miles to San Antonio for the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, offensive tackle Anthony Davis realized he could not leave his family in Piscataway, N.J., for college. So he decided he would remain close and attend Rutgers.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to stay at home,'' Davis said. ''I wouldn't want to live nowhere else but Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Before the second half of Saturday's game, Davis made his commitment public by slipping a Rutgers ball cap on his head before a nationwide television audience. He selected the Scarlet Knights over Ohio State and Southern California.</p>
        <p>''They're a rising program and I want to be a big part of it,'' Davis said.</p>
        <p>Davis, 17, who is 6 feet 5 inches and 330 pounds, is rated as the nation's second-best offensive tackle by Scout.com and is Rutgers's highest-ranked incoming recruit.</p>
