        <p>TO ease the trauma of filling in the same blanks over and over, the Common Application -- a four-page form that asks for basic information and a 250- to 500-word essay -- was created. But even Common App colleges want to get their two cents in, so they make students fill out supplements.</p>
        <p>Completing Northwestern's supplement is worthy of course credit. It asks for an essay of up to 500 words, a personal statement of up to 300 words and two shorter statements. Then there are the ''optional'' questions. The University of Pennsylvania requires an essay beyond the Common App's and invites a third should you need to make a further point about ''your intellectual abilities, your sense of imagination and your creativity.''</p>
        <p>Are these truly optional? ''On occasion, they can get you in,'' says Bruce Breimer, principal and director of college relations at the Collegiate School in Manhattan. ''Kids grumble, but they do them.''</p>
