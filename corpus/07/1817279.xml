        <p>Long Island law enforcement officials are struggling to determine the reasons for a 140 percent increase in bank robberies in the past four years. Since 2002, the number of bank robberies committed in Nassau County virtually tripled to 62 from 21 in 2006, and in Suffolk that number almost doubled to 51 from 26.</p>
        <p>One contributing factor may be the actual banks, said Detective Sgt. Robert Doyle, commander of Suffolk County's Major Case Investigation Unit. ''Gone are the days when banks were veritable fortresses,'' he said, adding that banks want to make customers feel as if they are in a living room and that most banks no longer employ security guards. ''It is much easier to commit a robbery due to the architectural features,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Long Island law enforcement officials are struggling to determine the reasons for a 140 percent increase in bank robberies in the past four years. Since 2002, the number of bank robberies committed in Nassau County virtually tripled to 62 from 21 in 2006, and in Suffolk that number almost doubled to 51 from 26.</p>
        <p>One contributing factor may be the actual banks, said Detective Sgt. Robert Doyle, commander of Suffolk County's Major Case Investigation Unit. ''Gone are the days when banks were veritable fortresses,'' he said, adding that banks want to make customers feel as if they are in a living room and that most banks no longer employ security guards. ''It is much easier to commit a robbery due to the architectural features,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Michael P. Smith, president of the New York Bankers Association, disagreed. While expressing concern about the increase in bank robberies, they occur randomly, he said. ''No one type of security is one size fits all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said the association had not received ''any calls from Nassau or Suffolk alerting or warning us to take extraordinary procedures,'' but added, ''To the extent we need to expand our efforts, we will.''</p>
        <p>Detective Sgt. John Giambrone, commander of the Nassau County Robbery Squad, said that numerous factors could explain the rise in bank robberies. He said some were committed by people to support drug habits and others because ''they are down on their luck.''</p>
        <p>The actual commission of a bank robbery, officials say, is still usually accomplished simply, with a note to the teller and a threat. ''I doubt there is any other business in Suffolk County where you present a note and receive money,'' Sergeant Doyle said.</p>
