        <p>IN Ossining, it's good riddance Riverhawk, hello ''O'' as the high school tries again to settle on a nickname.</p>
        <p>After cheering on the Indians for decades, Ossining High School changed its mascot in June 2002 after the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, requested that districts stop using American Indian symbols as mascots. But its successor, the Riverhawks -- which beat out the Cougars, the Wolf Pack, the Phoenix and the Eagles in a vote by students -- was never embraced, and recently a student group, the Senior Athletic Council, began pushing for a change.</p>
        <p>''They wanted to drop the Riverhawk,'' said James E. Dennett, the school's director of health, physical education and athletics, ''because it has never taken off.''</p>
        <p>Neither figuratively nor literally. The Riverhawk is not a hawk at all, but a type of iris. The made-up name was based on the bird and the town's proximity to the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>For now, the athletic council has decided to do without a mascot and replace the Riverhawk nickname with a simple O, which supporters say is more in line with the school's identity.</p>
        <p>''What we really wanted to do was get rid of the Riverhawk,'' said Brett Miranda, a leader on the sports council. ''Even when we were the Indians, people would still shout, 'Let's go O!' ''</p>
        <p>As the principal, Joshua Mandel, plans a ceremony to commemorate the Indians in the high school's hall of fame, the O is being used on team uniforms and is the focus of a booster club campaign, ''O Positive.''</p>
        <p>''O Positive is really about sportsmanship and spirit in Ossining,'' said Ken Davidov, the booster club president. ''In many ways, the O is bringing our town together.''</p>
