        <p>Forty-eight of the civilians killed were Hindi-speaking migrant laborers, the police said. The six government officials, some of them policemen, were killed in a bomb attack on their vehicle.</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 12, 2007, Friday  An article on Sunday about separatist rebel attacks in the northeast Indian state of Assam misstated its precise location. Assam borders several other Indian states and the kingdom of Bhutan; it does not border Myanmar.</p>
