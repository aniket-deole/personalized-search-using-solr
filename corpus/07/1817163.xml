        <p>Abject capitulation or tactical retreat? How to interpret the Shaw Group's reaction to shareholder complaints over the potential severance package for its founder and chief executive, James M. Bernhard Jr.?</p>
        <p>After protests by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which estimated that Mr. Bernhard's 10-year employment contract committed the company to giving him a golden parachute worth as much as $100 million, the company shortened the pact to just three years.</p>
        <p>Calpers had blasted Shaw, a construction and engineering company in Baton Rouge, La., saying it had ''some of the most egregious severance and change-of-control provisions ever,'' and urged fellow shareholders to cap severance packages at three times an employee's salary and bonus without explicit shareholder approval.</p>
        <p>While Shaw's board opposes the proposal, which will be put to a vote of shareholders on Jan. 30, its move to shorten Mr. Bernhard's contract effectively cut his severance pay to three times his salary and bonus.</p>
        <p>A Shaw spokesman, Christopher D. Sammons, declined to provide figures, but Calpers estimated that the exit pay could drop below $10 million.</p>
