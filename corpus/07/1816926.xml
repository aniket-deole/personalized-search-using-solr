        <p>Though the programs that Leon Botstein devises for the AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA often have a professorial tinge, they can be genuinely intriguing. Sunday afternoon, for example, he conducts ''Pioneering Influence: César Franck.'' The Frenchman Franck, often thought of as a 19th-century also-ran, is presented here as a powerful influence upon French composers who followed him, including Ernest Chausson, Paul Dukas (of ''Sorcerer's Apprentice'' fame) and the little-known Albéric Magnard. The program concludes with Franck's stormy Symphony in D minor. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $27 to $55.</p>
        <p>This week the WEILL MUSIC INSTITUTE AT CARNEGIE HALL presents a workshop with the eminent German organist and conductor HELMUTH RILLING. A chorus of volunteers, auditioned and prepared by Kathy Saltzman Romey, will be rehearsed and conducted by Mr. Rilling in a performance of Bach's ''St. Matthew'' Passion on Saturday night, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's and a roster of vocal soloists. Saturday at 7 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $25 to $82.</p>
        <p>ERNST KRENEK'S ''REISEBUCH AUS DEN ÖSTERREICHISCHEN ALPEN'' (''Diary From the Austrian Alps''), a major song cycle inspired by Schubert's ''Winterreise,'' is seldom performed, let alone complete. Krenek (1900-91), the Austrian modernist composer, has yet to get his due. So this concert on Tuesday in the intimate hall of the Austrian Cultural Forum is timely. The tenor Volker Vogel performs, accompanied by the pianist Ann Beckman. 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300; free, but reservations required.</p>
        <p>The kinetic conductor ZUBIN MEHTA, once the music director of the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, is back leading the orchestra in a work that will test his profundity, Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. The program includes Elgar's Cello Concerto with the brilliant young Alisa Weilerstein as soloist. Thursday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $28 to $96.</p>
        <p>Finally, for a jolt of the new, head downtown to the Kitchen for two performances by the adventurous contemporary music ensemble EIGHTH BLACKBIRD. Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; $10.</p>
