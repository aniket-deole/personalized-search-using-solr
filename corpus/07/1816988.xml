        <p>Written by Pedro Almodóvar</p>
        <p>In the bathroom, Raimunda (Penélope Cruz) is getting ready for a party at her restaurant. She is half made up. The effect is as if the part of her face that isn't made up has been erased. She is speaking in a loud voice so that her daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo), can hear her in the bedroom.</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- Paula! Get ready, people will start arriving in half an hour.</p>
        <p>In her room, Paula, serious and indolent, is lying on her bed, still wearing a track suit. She is reading a book by Paul Auster and doesn't deign to answer her mother. As she doesn't get an answer, Raimunda goes into Paula's room.</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- (fondly) Are you still like that?</p>
        <p>PAULA -- I'm not in the mood for a party.</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- Neither am I, but it's work. Come on, don't be such a lazybones. I'll help you. What's wrong?</p>
        <p>Raimunda sits on the bed with her daughter.</p>
        <p>PAULA -- (serious) I can't get him out of my head when he's so close, there, in the storeroom.</p>
        <p>Raimunda's forced optimism fades.</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- That's the best way to drive yourself crazy and to drive me crazy, too!</p>
        <p>PAULA -- Mom, you don't know what it's like to have killed your father!</p>
        <p>Raimunda looks at her and from her expression seems to be saying: ''There are some fathers who deserve it'' or ''You were just defending yourself.'' However, she says:</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- Paco wasn't your father.</p>
        <p>PAULA -- Mom, don't lie to me anymore. I know you're doing it for me, but please, don't lie.</p>
        <p>Raimunda's recently painted eyes fill up with tears that don't quite overflow. Defeated, wearily:</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- I'm not lying. Paco recognized you as his daughter, but he knew he wasn't your biological father.</p>
        <p>On the bedside table there is a framed photo of the three. Paula is just a baby. Paco is rocking her lovingly in his arms. Paula looks at the photo.</p>
        <p>PAULA -- Then  he was telling the truth.</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- (without any viciousness, but firmly) Yes, but that doesn't justify what he did.</p>
        <p>Paula, curious and stunned, looks at her mother, overwhelmed by memories.</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- (pleading) I promise I'll tell you everything, another time. I swear. And now, let's get ready. There's no point in sitting here.</p>
        <p>PAULA -- Who was my father?</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- Someone from the village.</p>
        <p>PAULA -- Do I know him?</p>
        <p>RAIMUNDA -- He's dead. (Pleading) Paula, I swear I'll tell you everything.  Paula looks at her and agrees.</p>
        <p>PAULA -- (adult) I'll hold you to your word.</p>
