        <p>I strongly disagree with the comment by Thomas J.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Bill Would Give Adoptees Access to Birth Records'' (Dec. 10):</p>
        <p>I strongly disagree with the comment by Thomas J. Snyder, secretary of the family law section of the New Jersey State Bar Association, that ''if this bill is enacted, it will be retroactively applied to people who have previously given up their children with the expectation and promises of privacy.''</p>
        <p>I've been a birth mother for 30 years, and I have never met or heard of a birth mother who doesn't dream of being reunited with her child.</p>
        <p>Privacy was the least of our concerns. When I relinquished in 1976, I did not request a guarantee of confidentiality. In fact, I left a neon trail of bread crumbs. Seven years ago my daughter made one phone call to our adoption agency and we spoke for the first time that same evening.</p>
        <p>My daughter has said that finally knowing her personal history has helped her make sense of the many questions that went unanswered for 23 years. I would have never prevented her from obtaining the very information she needed to find her sense of self.</p>
