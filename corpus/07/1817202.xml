        <p>Geno Auriemma, in his 22nd season as coach of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, recorded his 600th victory last week. The Huskies, who have won five national championships on his watch, won their first 12 games this season. He has been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>FRANK LITSKY</p>
        <p>HOW GOOD IS WOMEN'S BASKETBALL? -- It's better than it was, not as good as it should be. There are more good players and good programs. Games are much more competitive.</p>
        <p>WHAT DOES THE GAME NEED? -- Attention from school presidents and athletic directors. Take the Big East. There's not a football team in the league that isn't thinking about a bowl game. Men's basketball is strong. So is our game, but everyone doesn't know it. There's not a women's team in our league that can't beat the best teams in a lot of leagues around the country.</p>
        <p>WHAT CAN MAKE YOUR SEASON SUCCESSFUL? -- I know we're going to win a bunch of games and go to the N.C.A.A. tournament because we always do. What happens after that determines if we've had a successful season. Winning X number of games doesn't do it. Winning the national championship does.</p>
        <p>HOW CAN YOU MAKE YOUR TEAM BETTER? -- Probably not by rebuilding it every year. But you need to think that way until you get what you're looking for.</p>
        <p>DID YOU EVER THINK OF COACHING MEN? -- I've been approached. I was intrigued, but the timing was always wrong. Ten years ago, I would not have considered it. What had I accomplished? Some days now, I wonder if there is another challenge out there. That doesn't mean I'm going to do it.</p>
