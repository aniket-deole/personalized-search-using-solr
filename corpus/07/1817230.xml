        <p>A third youth has been arrested in connection with a series of vicious crimes in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens that left one man dead and another in a coma, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Herman Gonzalez, 19, of Van Cleef Street, just west of the park, was arrested Friday and charged with two counts of second-degree robbery, the police said.</p>
        <p>It was not immediately clear what role Mr. Gonzalez might have played in the crimes that the police say linked him to the two other suspects, Belter Yovanni Gubara Rivera and Marcos Polanco, both 17.</p>
        <p>But a law enforcement official said that on Nov. 20, he attacked a 20-year-old man delivering food on a bicycle. The man was punched and kicked, and the robber stole $200 and his cellphone, the official said, adding that Mr. Gonzalez had confessed.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Rivera and Mr. Polanco both confessed to attacking and robbing several people in the park between Nov. 22 and Dec. 25. They were being held without bail. One victim, Jae Woo Park, 36, of Little Neck, was severely beaten on Dec. 25 and was still unconscious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera was also charged with murder in the death of Carlos Flores, 40, whose lacerated body was found in one of the park's ponds on Dec. 5.</p>
