        <p>Introduced on Sunday: 2008 Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Dodge Caravan minivans</p>
        <p>Is it real? These boxy-looking new minivans are the long-awaited fifth generation production models. Really.</p>
        <p>What's the point? Though sales are fading quickly, minivans are still relatively big sellers at the Chrysler Group, which essentially invented the segment 24 years ago.</p>
        <p>What they said: In a poke at Ford and General Motors, Thomas W. LaSorda, chief executive of the Chrysler Group, said, ''If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen -- we're about to turn up the heat in the minivan kitchen.''</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: The minivan segment has never really recovered from Chrysler's killing of Plymouth and the very popular Voyager minivan in 2001. Minivan-based crossovers are the next big thing.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? Either a 3.3-liter flexible-fuel V-6 bolted to a four-speed automatic transmission, or choices of a 3.8- or a 4.0-liter V-6 (with 240 horsepower) coupled to a minivan-first six-speed automatic.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? The new minivans should start around $20,000 and top out at $40,000 loaded (with geegaws like swiveling seats, plug-in tables and two separate DVD systems) when they appear this fall as '08 models.</p>
        <p>How's it look? The interiors are high-tech and very entertaining. The exteriors? Yawn.</p>
