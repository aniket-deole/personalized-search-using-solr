        <p>KARLIN--Dorine, a feisty spirit coated in the softest skin you can imagine, passed away from us on December 29th at age 61. A storyteller extraordinaire with a gesticulating Jersey flair, she made the mundane comical. She loved people. A humble and selfless mentor at home, on the job and in her tireless charitable work; she will never know the extent of her influence. Charged and determined, this self-taught business woman built a still thriving computer-based training company with her late husband Syd in 1983. Her zeal for research would keep her awake until the wee hours investigating everything from the mechanisms of medicines to her grandkids' toys. Her pragmatic yet positive attitude made it easy to forget that she spent more than a decade living with lupus and breast cancer. She showed us that reality is what we make of it. To the end, she fought with grace and the force of life. In your honor, Dorine, we dream big, live in the moment and maintain our stand in the world with our feet squarely planted and our eyes sparkling. Survived by her kids Jen and Mark and a Gazillion other people who love her dearly. Gathering on January 14, 2:00 pm, 297 DeGraw Street, Brooklyn. Donations to the NJ Lupus Foundation/Research or Wichita N.O.W.</p>
