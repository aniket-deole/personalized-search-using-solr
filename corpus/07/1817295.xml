        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>''Bonding Over a Mascot'' (Dec. 29) was heartwarming on the one hand in terms of Seminole pride and heritage, but disheartening for using the term ''escaped slaves'' to describe descendant Africans as part of ''an amalgam'' that make up the Seminoles. The blanket use of ''escaped slaves'' fails to point out that among the Seminoles were descendant Africans whose presence among them went back decades. They were not there as slaves but as vassals or allies, or both, resident in their own village, Peliklakaha in central Florida, and under strong leadership. They were referred to as Black Seminoles, and were so interrelated with the tribe that Chief Micanopy took up official residence among them.</p>
