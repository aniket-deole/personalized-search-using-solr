        <p>Ann Z. Leventhal and Judge Jon O. Newman were married on Monday at their home in West Hartford, Conn. Cantor Pamela Siskin officiated.</p>
        <p>Ms. Leventhal, 70, will keep her name. She writes fiction and nonfiction, and her poetry has appeared in Prairie Schooner, the literary quarterly. She graduated from St. Joseph College in West Hartford and received a Master of Fine Arts in writing from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt. She is a daughter of the late Sadie Zinman and Samuel Zinman, who lived in Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
        <p>Judge Newman, 74, is on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. He served as its chief judge from 1993 to 1997. He graduated magna cum laude from Princeton and received his law degree from Yale.</p>
        <p>He is the son of the late Estelle Ormond, who lived in New York, and the late Harold Newman, who lived in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Leventhal and Judge Newman, both widowed, had long marriages: she to H. David Leventhal for 48 years and he to Martha Silberman for 51 years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Leventhal recalls first becoming aware of Judge Newman in 1958, when she saw him debate William F. Buckley Jr. and L. Brent Bozell Jr. ''I remembered him from that as being very attractive, but I was happily married,'' she said. ''I would see him and his wife at parties from time to time because we traveled in somewhat the same circles.''</p>
        <p>When she heard that Judge Newman's wife had died in 2005, Ms. Leventhal, who was by then a widow, said: ''I waited six weeks before sending him a letter saying, 'Would you like to have dinner with me?' I gave him my e-mail address, so he could say no without having to speak to me.''</p>
        <p>He didn't say no, but, he conceded, ''I didn't have a precise recollection until I saw her.''</p>
        <p>They went to a restaurant on April 3, 2005, and talked for seven hours. ''And we've been talking ever since,'' she said.</p>
