      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Giants (8-8) at Eagles (10-6)  4:30 p.m., Ch. 5</p>
        <p>EAGLES' BRIAN WESTBROOK VS. GIANTS' TIKI BARBER  Tiki Barber (1,662 yards rushing, 465 receiving) and Brian Westbrook (1,217 and 699) finished fifth and sixth in the N.F.L. in yards from scrimmage. They are small and versatile backs, and whoever has the better game will most likely be headed to the next round of the playoffs -- unless they cancel each other out, as they have done twice this season. The Eagles have the 26th-ranked rush defense, but held Barber to 126 yards on 40 carries in two meetings. The Giants, under their new play-caller, Kevin Gilbride, have vowed to be more committed to the run. While Eli Manning has played relatively well against the Eagles, and quarterback Jeff Garcia has sparked the Eagles' five-game winning streak, each team would like to put its chances in the hands of its ball carriers.</p>
        <p>BY THE NUMBERS, GIANTS vs. EAGLES</p>
        <p>3.15  Average gain per rush by Giants running back Tiki Barber in two games against the Eagles. In 14 other games, Barber averaged 5.4 yards a carry.</p>
        <p>8  Sacks of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by the Eagles on Sept. 17. He was not sacked more than twice in any other game, including the Dec. 17 rematch, when he was sacked once.</p>
        <p>23  Points scored by the Giants in the fourth quarter and overtime on Sept. 17 to overcome a 24-7 fourth-quarter deficit.</p>
        <p>22  Points scored by the Eagles in the fourth quarter on Dec. 17, leading to a 36-22 victory.</p>
        <p>QUOTABLE  ''We expected to be here. Yeah, we didn't get here the way that we wanted to, but we're here.''</p>
        <p>Giants running back Tiki Barber, on making the playoffs.</p>
