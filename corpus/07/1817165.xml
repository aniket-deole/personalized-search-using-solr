        <p>In its mission statement, the company says its executives are committed to a ''win-win'' for all parties involved in its business. But there is winning, and there is winning.</p>
        <p>Win Win Gaming, a Las Vegas company that makes gambling software for cellphones in China, recently settled a wrongful-termination lawsuit filed by David B. Coulter, even though Mr. Coulter never worked for Win Win and the company never fired him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coulter was the chief executive of Junum Inc., a credit repair service that Win Win bought in a reverse takeover in 2002, primarily for its listing as a publicly traded company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coulter sued in California, saying Win Win unfairly forced him out of Junum while taking it over.</p>
        <p>After fighting the lawsuit for almost four years, Win Win settled it just before the new year by agreeing to give Mr. Coulter $400,000, a list of credit-repair customers worth $2 million and options for 700,000 shares of Win Win stock.</p>
