        <p>Parents of young children vowing to venture out more in 2007 should log on to the Web site of Bugaboo, the Dutch company that designs strollers. At the beginning of next month, the ''day trips'' selections on www.bugaboo.com will be reintroduced with new features to mobilize even the most exhausted parents.</p>
        <p>The day trip sites are under ''Explore.'' Users can select from 19 American and European cities (there are plans to add 2 more cities outside Europe and North America), and find illustrated maps of those cities (each by a local artist) and snapshots of the various child-friendly destinations, each accompanied with instructions on what to see and do at each stop. Later, a gallery of photos sent in by parents who experienced the day trip will be posted, along with their comments.</p>

        <p>''We wanted to make our day trips really come to life,'' said Demaris Beems, a spokeswoman for Bugaboo. ''We like to inspire our customers to get out and go places. Bugaboo is about freedom of movement,'' she said, adding that as a ''mobility design'' company it has plans for products that will have nothing to do with parents and children.</p>
        <p>The sights chosen are not too child-centric -- Chinatown in New York is a featured map, and in Paris parents are sent to the Collette design boutique (above), while in Los Angeles they are directed to the Ivy for a kiwi daiquiri pick-me-up. Being a parent is a hard day's work.</p>
