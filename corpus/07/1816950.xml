        <p>To the Editor: It is disheartening that Museum Island in Berlin-- especially its Pergamon Museum -- was not mentioned in ''36 Hours: Berlin'' (Dec. 10). The Pergamon houses some of the reconstructed monumental wonders of the ancient world, transported from the Middle East in the last century by German archaeologists. Not to be missed are the Pergamon Altar, estimated to be about 2,000 years old, and the Ishtar Gate from Babylonia, below, which is estimated to be about 2,500 years old.</p>

        <p>In my years of travel, I have found visiting the Pergamon to be among life's most thrilling, life-changing experiences. It is well worth forgoing time spent in one of Berlin's oh-so-chic bistros to take a short, inspiring walk through this museum. It occurs to me that if we took a little more time to consider the ancient Middle East, we might gain insight into how disturbing its modern manifestation is by comparison.</p>
