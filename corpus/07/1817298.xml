        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>''Coaches' Word Rarely as Good as the Next Job'' (Dec. 30) gives many reasons coaches feign indifference in a job opening for which they have been mentioned, but ignores one of the most obvious and integral. By denying interest in the job, the prospect is engaging in a mating ritual whose purpose is not only to test the suitor's interest, but also to establish leverage for future negotiations, if it comes to that.</p>
