        <p>JETS' OFFENSIVE LINE VS. PATRIOTS' DEFENSE  In the teams' first meeting, the Jets' offensive line gave up four sacks in a 24-17 loss. In the November rematch, the Patriots were without the injured Ty Warren, their stellar left end. In his absence, the Jets were successful running the ball, gaining 117 yards on the ground (65 more than in the first game) en route to a 17-14 victory. Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork expects to return after missing three games with a sprained ankle. He will be a handful for Jets center Nick Mangold, who has been nursing a left thigh injury. The other rookie on the Jets' line, D'Brickashaw Ferguson, faces the difficult task of slowing the Patriots' right end, Richard Seymour, who has 4 sacks and 40 tackles.</p>
