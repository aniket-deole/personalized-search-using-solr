        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Gumbel's Studio Skills Are Lost in Transition to NFL Network Booth,'' Jan. 1: Bryant Gumbel calls the games the way serious football fans want it: the facts, and skip the personal baloney. The Monday night team in particular is so annoying with all the nongame chatter, you would think it was a talk show rather than a football game. You go, Bryant. I like the straightforward style that you and Cris Collinsworth deliver on the NFL Network.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I am glad not to hear an announcer blather about what is obvious to anyone watching the images of the game. Whether by design or not, I prefer to hear, ''First down, Giants. Barber,'' then nothing as I enjoy watching the end of the play.</p>
