        <p>Re ''Voices of Readers Online, Windows on the Newsroom'' (Dec. 17):</p>
        <p>I applaud The Times's efforts to interact with readers, but have some comments.</p>
        <p>In a Nov. 13 Talk to the Newsroom on the Web, Jill Abramson, a managing editor, in response to a question said that The Times had not reduced the quality of its journalism to save money. I wrote in and asked her to respond to the fact that here on Long Island, our suburban section has now been diluted with stories from New Jersey, Connecticut and Westchester. This, to me, certainly looks like a reduction in quality to save money. I used to be able to read stories about Long Island locations that meant something to me.</p>

        <p>I never received or saw a response from Ms. Abramson, and I never expected one since The Times, while still a great paper, is also still very good at not acknowledging its own faults. So much for your comment that the editors ''do not seem to be ducking all the hard'' questions.</p>

        <p>I, too, have become a great fan of The Times's various interactive features on its Web site. I note that in a Dec. 14 blog posting, David Pogue, the paper's technology columnist, addressed the problem of lack of civility on the Internet. It's nice to be nasty when no one knows your real name.</p>
