        <p>KURSH--Charlotte Olmsted, who died on December 27 at the age of 94, was the only child of the distinguished landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and granddaughter of the founder of landscape architecture in the United States, Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park in New York in 1858. Married for 23 years to Robert Lee Gill, Jr. of Baltimore, MD, who predeceased her. She is survived by their four children: Dr. Sarah Gill of Berkeley, CA, Dr. Stephen Paschall Gill of Atherton, CA, Jane Gill Shaler of High Point, NC, and Mary Gill Jordan of Fair Oaks, CA. After her children were grown, she embarked on a new career, earning her Ph.D. in anthropology at Stanford University and publishing many articles and books. She was married for 27 years to her second husband, artist and musician Maurice Kursh, who died in 1987, and was stepmother to Mr. Kursh's children by a previous marriage, Paula Kursh of Sebastopol, CA and Stephen Kursh of New York. Her remains will be interred in the Olmsted family vault in Hartford, Connecticut.</p>
