        <p>Television doesn't get much better than the first season of ''THE SOPRANOS.'' Now basic-cable subscribers who don't pay for HBO, or watch DVDs, or swap pirated videos online, can see what all the fuss is about when the series makes its premiere on A&amp;E (9 p.m. Wednesday), eight years to the day after it first appeared. Or most of the fuss, anyway. Will the bullet-and-profanity-riddled family crime drama be a different show with fully clothed strippers at the Bada Bing, or with Tony telling Artie that he's a ''really'' great cook? Yes, slightly. But it will still be really great.</p>
        <p>PBS tackles Topic A this week with the start of the four-hour series ''CHINA FROM THE INSIDE'' (9 p.m. Wednesday, most stations; check local listings). Produced by Granada Television and the San Francisco PBS affiliate KQED, the program addresses the power of the Communist Party, women's rights, the environment and religious freedom, and the producers have rounded up the requisite complement of true believers (or fast operators) and surprisingly frank dissenters. The series's content won't be a surprise to anyone who keeps up with the news, but its pictures, crossing the country from Xinjiang to Xiamen, are fascinating and beautiful.</p>
        <p>The first round of the NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAYOFFS continues on Sunday, and New York fans can enjoy -- or not -- consecutive games featuring the Jets against New England (1 p.m., CBS) and the Giants against Philadelphia (4:30 p.m., Fox). Those who prefer violence of the emotional variety can look forward to new episodes of ''GREY'S ANATOMY'' (ABC, 9 p.m. Thursday).</p>
