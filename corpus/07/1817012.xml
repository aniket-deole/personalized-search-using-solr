        <p>Ten years after the closing of the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, one of the largest psychiatric facilities in the country, a new plan for its redevelopment has been approved.</p>
        <p>After a judge dismissed a lawsuit over the sale of the land to a housing developer, state officials agreed Dec. 28 on a new plan to transfer the property to the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for use as parkland.</p>
        <p>A total of 368 acres will be added to Nissequogue River State Park, and 90 acres will be set aside for development. A separate 2.6 acres will be used by the Kings Park Fire District, and 36 acres will remain with the Office of Mental Health.</p>
        <p>Land where vacant buildings now stand will be leased to a developer, providing revenue to the park system.</p>
        <p>The transfer of the property was made possible when Judge Elizabeth Hazlitt Emerson of State Supreme Court in Riverhead dismissed a lawsuit on Dec. 15 that had been filed by the Arker Companies and Cherokee Northeast. Her ruling canceled the sale of the property to the developers, who had proposed 1,800 units of town houses and condominiums.</p>
        <p>The transfer to the state supersedes a proposal by State Senator John J. Flanagan, who had secured $25 million from the state to clean up the site and had been working to transfer the property to the Town of Smithtown. He called the revised plan ''a terrific opportunity for the residents of Kings Park.''</p>
        <p>''It protects taxpayers by preserving tax payments to the Kings Park School District and preserves the open space of this beautiful parcel of land,'' Mr. Flanagan said.</p>
        <p>Not everyone was as supportive. Patrick R. Vecchio, the Smithtown supervisor, said: ''It had been our hope that the land left for development would be transferred to the town so we could control our own destiny. Now we have no control over the 90 acres, and we are back to Square One.''</p>
