        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Studies on Ferry Service Come Amid Skepticism'' (Dec. 17), on potential ferry service linking Bridgeport, Stamford and New York City, describes the efforts of Joseph A. Riccio, the executive director of the Bridgeport Port Authority, to improve the traffic problems in Connecticut by promoting water transportation to New York City.</p>
        <p>The unmitigated increase of traffic has caused the federal government and the states to support ferry services that can help alleviate this problem. Our ferry -- a private service that carries passengers and vehicles between Bridgeport and Port Jefferson on Long Island -- has received some of those funds.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there's another side to this story in Bridgeport. Regrettably, the Bridgeport Port Authority, created in the early 1990s to generate income for a struggling Bridgeport, decided not to help our ferry, but to tax it.</p>
        <p>Over the years, this tax has taken more than $12 million from our ferry operation that could have been put to good use for the traveling public we try to serve.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority has spent much of the $12 million on ill-conceived projects that can only be described as wasteful. The high-speed ferry is but one example. Virtually everyone agrees that it is not economically viable, but that has not stopped the Port Authority from spending tax money it collects from our ferry, as well as government funds, to pursue that pipe dream.</p>
        <p>We have sued the Port Authority to cease the taxing of our ferry operation and to recover the overcharges. The trial, in United States District Court for Connecticut in Hartford, has concluded, and we are awaiting the court's decision.</p>
