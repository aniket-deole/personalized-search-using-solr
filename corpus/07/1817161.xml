        <p>On the very same day that he left Home Depot last week with an exit package worth at least $210 million, Robert L. Nardelli walked away from another prominent position -- without a cent.</p>
        <p>While he was still Home Depot's chairman and chief executive, Mr. Nardelli volunteered as the chairman of a disaster-response task force at the Business Roundtable, a kind of club for corporate chieftains that lobbies for their interests.</p>
        <p>Last month, he met at the White House with Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, and other top government and military officials to discuss improved collaboration on disaster preparedness.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, though, Mr. Nardelli had to quit the group. The Business Roundtable is only for sitting chief executives.</p>
        <p>At least he is in good company. The roundtable's former chairman, Hank McKinnell, had to quit last year after he was pushed out of Pfizer, coincidentally with his own $200 million severance package.</p>
