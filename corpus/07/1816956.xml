      <abstract>
        <p>Two letters comment on Dec 17, 2006, Zev Chafets article on Wall Street Pentecostals; Jeffrey Coogan says article may have unwittingly promoted pastors' cause by repeating their claims of miracle-working powers; Geri Spanek says he found article amusing</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I'm sure that the purpose of Zev Chafets's article (Dec. 17) about the Wall Street Pentecostals was merely to exhibit a bit of cultural exotica to secular New Yorkers. But he may have unwittingly promoted the pastors' cause by repeating, without comment, their claims of miracle-working powers. If pharmaceutical companies are legally required to prove that an aspirin works as advertised, it is an outrage that faith healers can rake in millions of dollars claiming that they can cure cancer and raise people from the dead. It is long past time for government to step in.</p>

        <p>Articles about religious fundamentalists like Dan and Ann Stratton often anger and frighten me. This time, I couldn't stop laughing. It must be wonderful to have all the answers. I can't help but wonder, though, how people capable of performing miracles like raising the dead are unable to find a permanent location in Lower Manhattan. Oh, I forgot; that's Satan's fault.</p>
