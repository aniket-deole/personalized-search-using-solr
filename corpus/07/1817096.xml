        <p>Rachel Leigh Glazer, a daughter of Patsy Glazer and Dr. Donald J. Glazer of Richmond, Va., was married there last evening to Kenneth Henriques Coelho, a son of Jane L. Coelho and Dr. Gary H. Coelho of New York. Rabbi Gary Creditor performed the ceremony at Temple Beth-El.</p>
        <p>The bride, 25, graduated from the University of Tennessee and is studying for a master's degree in early childhood education at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. Her father is a podiatrist in Richmond. Her mother is a preschool teacher at the Jewish Community Center there.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 28, is a media-planning supervisor at LM&amp;O Advertising, an agency in Arlington, Va. He graduated from Cornell. His mother works in New York as the coordinator of office volunteers at Doctors Without Borders. His father is a dentist in New York.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Glazer moved to New York three years ago, she was occasionally asked to baby-sit for the grandchildren of Helen Lobel, a longtime friend of Mr. Coelho's mother.</p>
        <p>''Rachel was coming to my daughter's home to baby-sit, and I was there when she walked in,'' Mrs. Lobel remembered. ''I looked at her and said, 'I know who you're going to marry.' ''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lobel phoned Mr. Coelho and told him: ''I've met a wonderful girl who is new in New York. She has no boyfriend, so here is her number.''</p>
        <p>She instructed both of them: ''Don't tell me how it went, don't call me. Eventually I will know either way.''</p>
        <p>The introduction repaid an old debt. It was Mr. Coelho's mother who fixed up Mrs. Lobel with her husband, Steven.</p>
