        <p>Erica Piccininni, an actress, is to be married in Newark today to Andrew Brad Brettler, a lawyer. The Rev. Deborah Steen Ross, an interfaith minister, is to officiate at the Newark Club, a caterer, with Rabbi Roger Ross, her husband, taking part.</p>
        <p>The bride, 27, will continue to use her name professionally. She is in the Broadway musical ''Jersey Boys.'' She also had a starring role in ''Palm Beach: The Screwball Musical'' at the La Jolla Playhouse in California in 2005. She graduated from New York University.</p>
        <p>She is a daughter of Frances Piccininni and Joseph Piccininni of Tenafly, N.J. Her father is the vice president for finance at Gilmar USA, a textile importer and exporter in New York.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 29, is an associate at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, the New York law firm, and is to become a law clerk to Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan in March. He graduated from Rutgers and received a degree magna cum laude from Brooklyn Law School.</p>
        <p>He is a son of Susan K. Brettler and Norman Brettler of Cherry Hill, N.J. His father is a partner in Tilton Dynamic Imaging, a magnetic resonance imaging clinic in Northfield, N.J.</p>
        <p>Ms. Piccininni and Mr. Brettler met in 2000, when a friend of his arranged for him to meet Ms. Piccininni's sister, Lisa. But Lisa asked her sister to come along.</p>
        <p>The bride remembers, ''Andrew and I had instant chemistry, making fun of each other all night long, just ripping on each other.''</p>
