        <p>The City of Passaic, faced with a rising number of day laborers standing on street corners and in parking lots in hopes of landing work, opened a center last week that is to serve as a hub for those looking for a day job.</p>

        <p>The City of Passaic, faced with a rising number of day laborers standing on street corners and in parking lots in hopes of landing work, opened a center last week that is to serve as a hub for those looking for a day job.</p>
        <p>The building on Parker Avenue is across the street from a Home Depot. Mayor Samuel Rivera said the center was necessary because some of the nearly 100 people a day waiting for work were loitering on homeowners' porches when it rained and some were harassing parents dropping off children at a nearby school.</p>
        <p>''It became a menace, and they were getting fresh,'' Mr. Rivera said in a telephone interview. ''I had to send the police there, but we wanted a better solution.''</p>
        <p>So the workers rented and renovated a rundown storefront building and will now report to the center's waiting area. Contractors looking for workers are expected to go to the center to fill out paperwork requesting laborers' services.</p>
        <p>''Some men were not getting paid,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''This will cut down on that problem.''</p>
        <p>The center will be staffed and financed by the workers. In exchange for the renovations, the landlord agreed to give them six months' free rent and then charge them $500 a month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera said there were logistical problems in the first few days as workers tried to figure out who among them would run the center. He has granted a one-month grace period to get the center operational before the police resume ticketing workers who loiter on the street.</p>
