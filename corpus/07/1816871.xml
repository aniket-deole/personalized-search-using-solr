        <p>Road Scholar is offering a new educational tour through Rwanda, a country both celebrated for its gorillas and shunned for its 1994 genocide. The 10-day trip, ''Rwanda: Tracking the Mountain Gorilla,'' will take small groups on hikes through the Virunga volcanoes to observe the gorillas (below). Other excursions include Akagera National Park and the Gisozi Genocide Memorial. The trip fee starts at $6,087 a person (www.roadscholar.org).  Sandals Grande Antigua Resort and Spa is set to open its Mediterranean Village next month. The $70 million addition to the 19-acre resort complex in Antigua will have 180 ocean-view suites, a pool, four restaurants and 3,200 square feet of shopping space. Rates start at $675 a person per night (www.sandals.com).  MTV has published three guides for young travelers. The guides -- MTV Ireland, MTV Italy and MTV Europe -- were written by 13 college-age travelers who will also be responsible for writing future guides on Spain, the United States, France and England. MTV podcasts are also available on www.frommers.com/podcast.</p>
