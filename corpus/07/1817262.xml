        <p>Darren Linkin letter says he agrees with public editor Byron Calame (Dec 17, 2006, column) that New York Times has no control over what he, Calame, writes, but points out that Times pays Calame's salary</p>

        <p>Re ''The Times Speaks for Itself'' (Dec. 17): In response to those who say you speak for The New York Times, you say that ''it exercises absolutely no control over what I write in the space regularly provided to me'' and give several examples and arguments why that is true.</p>
        <p>I believe and agree with you. But at the end of the day, your paycheck comes from the paper, which means it is possible (though not necessarily true) either that you may occasionally consciously or unconsciously censor yourself, or that one day the paper may stop paying you.</p>

        <p>If either of these events occurred (which you may not or cannot absolutely know or predict), it would then contradict your ''absolute'' statement.</p>
