      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>These two- and three-star restaurants, all on or near Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron district, reflect a quiet, almost elegant dining scene that is turning the area into the grown-up's answer to the teeming, trendy meatpacking district, just off to the west.</p>
        <p>BLT FISH ***  [rating: three stars]  (212) 691-8888; 21 West 17th Street (Fifth Avenue); $$$; Review: 4/20/05.</p>
        <p>Possibly the best of Laurent Tourondel's BLT restaurants, BLT Fish presents great food without airs, its standards exacting but its sense of play generous. It allows the indulgence of different sensibilities and moods, letting diners take from it what they want, be it whole fish as pure and clean as anything likely to swim in the direction of dinner, or seafood done up in cheekier fashions.</p>
        <p>FLEUR DE SEL **  [rating: two stars]  (212) 460-9100; 5 East 20th Street (Fifth Avenue); $$$$; Review: 12/13/00.</p>
        <p>Cyril Renaud, chef and owner, creates quiet excitement here. The current menu includes sugar cane and coffee marinated pork chop with cepes and white sweet potato purée; and fingerling-potato-crusted striped bass with broccoli purée and maple red wine sauce.</p>
        <p>MESA GRILL **  [rating: two stars]  (212) 807-7400; 102 Fifth Avenue (16th Street); $$$; Review: 5/24/00.</p>
        <p>This restaurant has been a hit since its opening in 1991. Bobby Flay, the chef, produces dishes like New Mexican spice-rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon-ancho chili sauce and sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter, and ancho chili honey-glazed salmon with spicy black bean sauce and roasted jalapeño crema.</p>
        <p>PERIYALI **  [rating: two stars]  (212) 463-7890; 35 West 20th Street (Fifth Avenue); $$; Review: 5/18/05.</p>
        <p>Periyali was a trailblazer when it opened 20 years ago, a time when upscale Greek was a contradiction, a gyro-defying leap of imagination and faith. Today, after renovations last summer, the restaurant has a lighter, modern look and a menu to match. But Periyali still serves octopus marinated in red wine, as well as moussaka, and with its enormous bouquets of fresh flowers and a ceiling of undulating white linen, the dining room is as calm and calming as the Aegean on a windless day.</p>
        <p>TOCQUEVILLE **  [rating: two stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 647-1515; 1 East 15th Street (Fifth Avenue); $$$; Review: 12/6/06.</p>
        <p>Tocqueville moved last year from one end of an East 15th Street block to the other. It now feels like a much more proper restaurant. Its shortcomings, including uneven service, are more noticeable in the context of a changed image and expectations. But the considerable pleasures of Marco Moreira's cooking are intact, as is a serious wine list.</p>
        <p>Try the duo of seared sirloin and braised short rib, and the roasted chicken, whose tenderness underscores the care this kitchen takes.</p>
