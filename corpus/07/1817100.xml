        <p>For decades, some clothing shops have quietly doubled as art salons. Here are four recent additions, in Lower Manhattan and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that serve as vibrant ad hoc galleries. If you go, you might strike up a conversation with a stylish stranger about the latest concert at Northsix, or take home a little culture with your $500 sweater.</p>
        <p>ELLEN CARPENTER</p>
        <p>Jumelle  148 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn  (718) 388-9525</p>
        <p>Candice Waldron traded in a career as a TV journalist to open her Williamsburg boutique last April. At the moment, a lush oil painting by Anna Schachte overlooks peep-toe heels, purses and flirty gowns like a silk halter dress by 3.1 Phillip Lim (above, $358). Jumelle showcases up-and-coming designers like Caitlin Mociun of Park Slope, and established lines like the French label Cacharel. Soon, the Schachte painting will make way for delicate nature prints and photographs of urban landscapes by Maria Passarotti.</p>
        <p>I Heart  262 Mott Street, Manhattan  (212) 219-9265</p>
        <p>This NoLIta boutique will auction prints by the New York graphic artist J. Penry this month; those who would rather invest in clothes might like a Mala Brajkovic sundress ($369, right).</p>
        <p>Lisa Levine Jewelry  536 Metropolitan Avenue, Brooklyn  (718) 349-2824</p>
        <p>At her new shop, Lisa Levine sells work like feather and metal earrings ($140) and a vintage coin bracelet ($265). The art? Sleek wood shelves by John Roche, a Cooper Union grad.</p>
        <p>Leontine  226 Front Street, Manhattan  (212) 766-1066</p>
        <p>Get out your walking shoes to visit Leontine, which opened two months ago on a renovated block near South Street Seaport. A third sister to Kyung Lee's boutiques Albertine and Claudine, the boudoirlike space is decorated with murals by a Brooklyn artist, Virginia Loughnan (who also makes lingerie for the shop). Wares also include hand-sewn pieces by Christina Hattler (the mannequin's lace dress, $956, is hers) as well as vintage Parisian party dresses. Philippa Content, a jeweler who works in the store, turns Victorian landscape agates into rings and necklaces. Customers itching for their own creations can join Ms. Lee's new weekly knitting club.</p>
        <p>No. 6  6 Centre Market Place, Manhattan  (212) 226-5759</p>
        <p>Last fall, a year after opening their Little Italy shop, Morgan Yakus and Karin Bereson co-published the first book in a planned series by artists and performers. It pairs drawings by the indie-folk musician Devendra Banhart with poems by Dana Kline, a musician and writer. Mr. Banhart's pictures are now in the windows (left, top). On the racks, vintage finds mingle with designs from rising stars like Camilla Staerk, including her embossed leather boots (left, $385). The gold crocheted chain necklace ($420) is by Arielle De Pinto of Montreal.</p>
        <p>Groupe 16sur20  267 Elizabeth Street, Manhattan  (212) 343-0007</p>
        <p>This younger brother of the shop Seize sur Vingt, a NoLIta favorite, has its very own curator, a private collector. A collection of ephemera from exhibitions by the late German artist Martin Kippenberger is the focus now; past shows have included photos by Larry Clark and Nan Goldin. The store also exhibits vintage cars, like a 1987 Ferrari Testarossa, right -- yours for a mere $90,000, marked down from $102,000 -- along with clothes and accessories for men.</p>
