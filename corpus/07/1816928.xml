        <p>In 2006 more movies than usual -- a record, by some estimates -- were released in theaters without being shown to critics. Most were horror movies or lowbrow comedies aimed at teenagers, movies whose target audiences are not believed to read reviews in the first place. But one title stands out in this junk pile: MIKE JUDGE'S ''IDIOCRACY,'' which never even played in New York during its surreptitious commercial run last fall. (It was briefly booked on a single Manhattan screen but then pulled when the theater scheduled advance screenings for critics.)</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, in the midst of the January Hollywood fire-sale season, ''Idiocracy'' will be released on DVD, giving those of us who missed it -- this critic included -- a chance to see what the absence of fuss was all about. Witness testimony suggests a variation on the ''Sleeper'' theme: LUKE WILSON hibernates for 500 years and awakens not in a technologically advanced dystopia, but in a world of utter stupidity. Sounds plausible to me, and intriguing as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Judge, a sometime actor and the creative mind behind ''Office Space,'' ''Beavis and Butt-head'' and ''King of the Hill,'' is an idiosyncratic pop-culture genius, and also the kind of satirist who confounds easy ideological pigeon-holing. Writing in Slate, the conservative journalist and blogger Reihan Salam described ''Idiocracy'' as ''the most potent political film of the year, and the most stirring defense of traditional values since Edmund Burke's 'Reflections on the Revolution in France.' '' Come to think of it, I never got invited to an advance screening of that one either.</p>
