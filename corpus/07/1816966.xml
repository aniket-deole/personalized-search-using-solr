        <p>Minnesota's in Long Beach, established in 1994, is the kind of place where everybody knows not only your name, but also which New York football team you pledge allegiance to.</p>
        <p>Not that it matters whether you root for the Jets or the Giants. On Sundays, fans are welcome to cheer every N.F.L. game being played that day, from the 1 p.m. kickoff to the 8:30 evening game, on one of the 11 plasma screens (42-inch) suspended above and around the massive mahogany bar.</p>

        <p>Minnesota's in Long Beach, established in 1994, is the kind of place where everybody knows not only your name, but also which New York football team you pledge allegiance to.</p>
        <p>Not that it matters whether you root for the Jets or the Giants. On Sundays, fans are welcome to cheer every N.F.L. game being played that day, from the 1 p.m. kickoff to the 8:30 evening game, on one of the 11 plasma screens (42-inch) suspended above and around the massive mahogany bar.</p>
        <p>Regulars come for the upscale pub atmosphere, acoustic live music between games, and a creative brunch and dinner menu that is served wherever you can find a seat on a rollicking Sunday afternoon. Perching on a barstool gives you the flexibility to walk around and see multiple games at once. Settling in at one of the tables in the adjacent dining room, accented with wrought-iron banisters and a gas fireplace, offers a view of two eight-foot projection screens that create a virtual wall of high-definition football action.</p>
        <p>Although there are plenty of standard bar menu favorites, like the Viking Platter combo of chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks and buffalo wings ($16), the appetizers steer into Asian fusion territory with a tower of orange-ginger fried calamari, tossed with hearts of palm, bananas and toasted peanuts ($12), and a hearty Philly cheese steak egg roll ($9). Brunch, served 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays, includes a selection of omelets ($10), salads ($9 to $14) and burgers ($10). Ambitious dinner entrees like sesame-crusted seared ahi tuna ($24) and filet mignon in a cherry-plum wine sauce ($30) are served from 3 until 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>With eight beers on tap ($4 to $5) and an elaborate martini bar menu ($7 to $8), there is fuel enough for a gridiron marathon.</p>
        <p>Minnesota's Restaurant and Tavern, 959 West Beech Street, Long Beach; (516) 432-4080. www.minnesotasny.com.</p>
