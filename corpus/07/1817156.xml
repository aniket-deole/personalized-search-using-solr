        <p>It's time to put the record Wall Street bonuses you've heard about in perspective. Yes, a few investment stars did reap tens of millions, topped by Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs, who received $53.4 million.</p>

        <p>What? Does that still seem like a lot to you? Maybe you were one of those unfortunate workers whose bonus was four or even just three or two figures.</p>
        <p>Or (and you don't need to identify yourselves) maybe your bonus was just one figure: zero, an increase of zero percent over 2005.</p>
        <p>If so, look at it this way: The data below are courtesy of the New York State comptroller's office, which takes an intense interest in bonuses at tax time. The tax bite from a six-figure bonus is likely to be substantial, whereas the tax you have to pay on a nonexistent bonus is  zero.</p>
