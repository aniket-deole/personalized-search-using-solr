        <p>Written by Michael Arndt</p>
        <p>Near the end of the film, Dwayne (Paul Dano) and his uncle Frank (Steve Carell) are each coming to terms with life-altering disappointments. Dwayne, an antisocial 15-year-old, has just learned that he cannot pursue his dream of becoming a Navy test pilot because he is colorblind. Frank, a depressed Proust scholar, has lost both his lover and his pre-eminent reputation to an academic rival.  Dwayne nods. He looks out to sea.</p>
        <p>DWAYNE -- Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep until I was 18. Just skip all this [expletive] -- high school and everything. Just skip it</p>
        <p>He shakes his head.</p>
        <p>FRANK -- Y'ever hear of Marcel Proust?</p>
        <p>DWAYNE -- He's the guy you teach?</p>
        <p>FRANK -- Yeah. French writer. Total loser. Never had a real job. Unrequited love affairs. Gay. Spent his last 20 years writing a book that almost no one reads. But  he was also probably the greatest writer since Shakespeare. Anyway, he gets down to the end of his life, and he looks back and he decides that all the years he suffered -- all the years he was miserable -- those were the best years of his life. Because they made him who he was. They forced him to think and grow, and to feel very deeply. And the years he was happy? Total waste. Didn't learn anything.</p>
        <p>Dwayne grins.</p>
        <p>FRANK -- So, if you go to sleep until you're 18 (scoffs) Think of all the suffering you'd miss! High school's your prime suffering years. You don't get better suffering than that! Unless you go into academia, but that's a whole different story.</p>
        <p>They share a smile.</p>
