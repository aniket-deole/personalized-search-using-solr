        <p>Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, the branch of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that runs the subways and buses, announced his resignation yesterday, clearing the way for new leadership at the agency he has run since 1996. Finding a replacement for Mr. Reuter, above, will now become one of the first tasks for the transportation authority's incoming executive director and chief executive, Elliot G. Sander. Mr. Sander was chosen to head the authority by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who has frequently called for a management shake-up at the agency. Mr. Reuter said his departure was not influenced by the change in administration. He plans to leave the authority in early February and will take a job in Miami with Parsons Brinckerhoff, a large engineering company.</p>
