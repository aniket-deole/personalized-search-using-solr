        <p>Change is in the air at the State Capitol, but the top faces in the Legislature are staying the same. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, were both confirmed on Wednesday as the leaders of their respective chambers -- positions they have held since 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno was re-elected temporary president of the Senate on a unanimous voice vote despite his disclosure last month that federal authorities were looking into his business activities.</p>
        <p>The federal investigation did not seem to shake the confidence of the Senate's Republicans.</p>
        <p>''We all know Joe Bruno, he knows you, and he's run this house with some efficiency not formerly seen -- starting on time; ending sessions on time, more or less; and no 4 o'clock in the morning sessions,'' Senator Owen H. Johnson, a Suffolk County Republican, said in sponsoring the resolution to re-elect Mr. Bruno as temporary president.</p>
        <p>Not a single ''nay'' vote was heard, because Senator John J. Bonacic of the Hudson Valley, the only Republican dissenter, had left the chamber before the vote to symbolically register his protest.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a cloud over him, and that cloud is getting thicker every day,'' Mr. Bonacic said of Mr. Bruno in an interview afterward. ''And my concern is more for the conference and the message that the conference sends out -- that it doesn't get diluted or distracted by the problems of our majority leader with the federal investigation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno said after the vote, ''These are challenging times, these are days that are problematic -- more problematic for some than for others.'' He added, ''And I'm here now, and I can tell you, we will overcome whatever challenges are out there.''</p>
