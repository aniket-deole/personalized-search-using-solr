        <p>Imagine if Ian Schrager opened a youth hostel. Such is the concept behind the Pod Hotel, which is opening on East 51st Street in stages this month, with rooms becoming available as they are completed.</p>
        <p>Formerly the Pickwick Arms, a drab Midtown lodging, the Pod Hotel holds 347 rooms barely larger than walk-in closets. A 100-square-foot hotel room for two may be a tough sell, even in New York. But the owners are betting that guests (target age: 18 to 25) will overlook the cramped quarters if they offer high design at a low price. Rates start at $89 a night for a compact single room, above left, made for the traveler who just wants to dive into bed.</p>

        <p>Imagine if Ian Schrager opened a youth hostel. Such is the concept behind the Pod Hotel, which is opening on East 51st Street in stages this month, with rooms becoming available as they are completed.</p>
        <p>Formerly the Pickwick Arms, a drab Midtown lodging, the Pod Hotel holds 347 rooms barely larger than walk-in closets. A 100-square-foot hotel room for two may be a tough sell, even in New York. But the owners are betting that guests (target age: 18 to 25) will overlook the cramped quarters if they offer high design at a low price. Rates start at $89 a night for a compact single room, above left, made for the traveler who just wants to dive into bed.</p>
        <p>''Our guest is the stylish spendthrift,'' said Richard Born, a principal of BD Hotels, which also owns Manhattan hotels like the Maritime and the Mercer.</p>
        <p>The Pod Hotel is the first of its kind to open in the United States, though capsule hotels have operated in Japan for more than two decades. The stripped-down easyHotel opened in London in 2005, and the chain has since spread through Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>Vanessa Guilford, the Pod Hotel's designer, has echoed transportation's efficient use of space. Bunk beds suggest sleeper cars on trains, and in rooms without bathrooms, a symbol above the door turns green when a shared hallway bathroom is vacant -- a detail borrowed from airplanes. Flip-down coat hooks are the same as those found on Amtrak trains.</p>
        <p>''The idea was to keep it all cheap and cheerful,'' Ms. Guilford said, ''and to simplify it as much as possible.'' In the lounge, above right, a mural by James Rizzi sets the tone. The Pod Hotel is at 230 East 51st Street. For reservations, (212) 355-0300.</p>
