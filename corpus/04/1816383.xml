        <p>An Iowa family that fell ill at a Key West hotel nearly a week before a man who stayed in the same room died of carbon monoxide poisoning has sued the hotel, claiming they were injured. David and Jody Smith and their son Nathan, of Ankeny, Iowa, stayed at the hotel, the Doubletree Grand Key Resort, and were treated at a local hospital on Dec. 21, less than a week before Thomas Lueders, 26, died from inhaling carbon monoxide fumes that came from a boiler adjacent to his room. The Smiths' lawsuit seeks compensation for hospital expenses and emotional anguish. Ira Leesfield, the lawyer for the Smiths, said he expected at least three other families to join the suit.</p>
