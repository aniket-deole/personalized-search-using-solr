        <p>Push-to-talk, another name for walkie-talkie cellphone features, has been popular for years, but until recently it was largely available on Nextel phones. Now you can get push-to-talk from Cingular as well, and the LG CU400 cellphone it recently began offering adds high-speed data services to the mix.</p>
        <p>The CU400 is a G.S.M. phone that will work on cellular networks overseas. The push-to-talk service allows you to connect to another user of the service on Cingular or even send a broadcast message to up to 30 contacts.</p>

        <p>Push-to-talk, another name for walkie-talkie cellphone features, has been popular for years, but until recently it was largely available on Nextel phones. Now you can get push-to-talk from Cingular as well, and the LG CU400 cellphone it recently began offering adds high-speed data services to the mix.</p>
        <p>The CU400 is a G.S.M. phone that will work on cellular networks overseas. The push-to-talk service allows you to connect to another user of the service on Cingular or even send a broadcast message to up to 30 contacts.</p>
        <p>The phone has a monochrome external screen, a bright main screen, a basic camera, Bluetooth wireless capabilities and supports Cingular's streaming audio and video services. It offers about five hours of talk time on one charge and weighs three ounces.</p>
        <p>The CU400 sells for $30 with a two-year contract and rebate or $230 without a contract. Unlimited push-to-talk is $10 a month for each phone or $20 for a family plan.</p>
        <p>Sleek styling and a rubberized finish ensure that nobody will mistake this phone for a walkie-talkie.</p>
