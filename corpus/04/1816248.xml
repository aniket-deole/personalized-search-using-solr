        <p>NOTHING says winter like a fire crackling in a fireplace or roaring in an outdoor pit. New tools and accessories not only enhance the experience, but also make welcome gifts from weekend houseguests. And for those who enjoy barbecuing, there is a special fireplace grill for ''cooking out'' indoors.</p>
        <p>1. FlameX deluxe safety gloves, made of heavyweight leather, are flexible enough to use when working with logs or tools. The palms have a layer of insulating leather and are lined with foil for extra protection. The gloves are not fireproof; $27 a pair at spitjack.com or (800) 755-5509.</p>
        <p>2. Forest Hill, a hand-forged steel four-piece tool set from Stone County Ironworks, is $696; for information: stoneiron.com or (800) 223-4722.</p>
        <p>3. Fireglass can be used in gas fireplaces as a decorative accent. The tempered glass chips do not burn, so they don't need to be replaced. Filler Fireglass, used for the bottom layer, comes in more than a dozen colors ($2.90 to $10 a pound), while brightly colored Topping Fireglass ($7.50 to $9 a pound) can be sprinkled over it to create a striking look. A calculator on the company's Web site helps determine how much glass is needed for a specific fireplace; woodlanddirect.com or (800) 919-1904.</p>
        <p>4. The Al Fresco fireplace is an outdoor fire pit made of recycled iron. Handmade in Haiti, it varies slightly in size, about 31 inches in diameter and 24 inches high; $250 at sundancecatalog.com or (800) 422-2770.</p>
        <p>5. The Leaf single panel fire screen is 38 inches wide and 30.5 inches high; $388 from Stone County Ironworks. For information: stoneiron.com or (800) 223-4722.</p>
        <p>6. The Fireside log stand, designed by Peter Maly for the German company Conmoto, is made of stainless steel and leather; $1,350 at unicahome.com or (888) 898-6422.</p>
        <p>7. The Scroll wrought-iron mantel is 60 inches long and 14 inches deep. It comes with predrilled holes so it can be fastened to the wall; $1,799 at woodlanddirect.com or (800) 919-1904.</p>
        <p>8. An adjustable steel grill for cooking in a fireplace has a built-in drip pan and folds up for storage. The grate is 16.5 inches by 18.5 inches deep; $149 at spitjack.com or (800) 755-5509.</p>
        <p>9. Handmade fireplace tools by Marco Ferreri are made of recycled railroad track; a set of three is $600 at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum shop, 2 East 91st Street; (212) 849-8355.</p>
