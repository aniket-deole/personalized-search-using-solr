        <p>Demanding raises for 1,300 state and local judges, four jurists have taken the rare step of suing the governor, Legislature and court system. The suit, filed Friday in State Supreme Court, contends that inflation has effectively cut salaries 28 percent since the last raise, in 1999, violating a constitutional bar against reducing judges' compensation. The suit also accuses legislators of linking judicial pay to their own, violating the separation of powers and ignoring the fact that judges work full time with limited outside work, unlike legislators. The lawyer filing the suit, Steven Cohn, said he had been inundated with support from judges. A court spokesman declined to comment but said court officials were pushing hard for raises. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has said he also supports raises for judges. Legislative leaders declined to comment.</p>
