        <p>With the holiday season ended, NBC returned to original programming on Tuesday, winning the night in total viewers for the first time this season. According to Nielsen's estimate, NBC's ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' garnered 13.4 million viewers at 9 p.m., the show's largest audience in more than a year. NBC also dominated the 10 p.m. hour with ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' (15.1 million), which drew the night's highest ratings. NBC's ''Dateline'' (9.5 million) ranked second in the 8 p.m. hour. Meanwhile Orange Bowl coverage of Louisville's win over Wake Forest appeared to give Fox an edge over CBS for No. 2 for the night. The game averaged 10.6 million viewers according to time-zone adjusted estimates. CBS received relatively strong ratings for repeats of ''NCIS'' at 8 (13 million) and ''The Unit'' at 9 (9.1 million), but a rerun of ''Numb3rs,'' which is usually broadcast on Fridays, earned 6.7 million viewers at 10. ABC finished fourth with repeats of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' at 8 (8.1 million) and ''Boston Legal'' at 10 (5 million), as well as two new episodes of ''Big Day'' at 9 (5.2 million) and 9:30 (4.8 million).</p>
