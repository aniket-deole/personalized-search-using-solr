Caring brother of Hope Schmertz, the late David Schmertz, and Jerry Grossman and the late Barbara Grossman. Adoring uncle of Susan and Paul Schmitt, Nancy and Jeff Wollman, Michael and Anjanette Grossman, Gary and Sherri Schmertz, Joan and Jason Flores and their children. Loyal friend to countless people and ''extended family'' whose lives he touched in so many special ways by his kind heart, gentle and humble nature, compassionate spirit, unique sense of humor and brilliance. Graduated with honors in 1957 from Cornell University and in 1960 from New York University School of Law, following which he had a distinguished legal career. Retired as a partner and appellate counsel of the N.Y.C. law firm of Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, and Mackauf. Past president of B'nai Brith North Hills Lodge and longstanding member of Shelter Rock Jewish Center. Past chairman of the N.Y.S. Trail Lawyers Association ''Decisions'' lecture Series.

        <p>$(6$)SCHMERTZ--Herman. Dear friend of our youth who we loved and cherished. He was intelligent, humble, kind and caring. He left us too soon. Barbara and Donald Spanton</p>
        <p>$(6$)SCHMERTZ--Herman. We mourn the loss of a close friend of over 50 years, a truly great human being. Our condolences to Judi, Gail, Robert and family. Dottie and Marty</p>
