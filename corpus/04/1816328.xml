        <p>Following is the first half of a poem attributed to Saddam Hussein, as transcribed and translated by The New York Times from a reading by his cousin Muayed Dhamin al-Hazza.</p>
        <p>Unbind It</p>
        <p>Unbind your soul. It is my soul mate and you are my soul's beloved.</p>
        <p>No house could have sheltered my heart as you have</p>
        <p>If I were that house, you would be its dew</p>
        <p>You are the soothing breeze</p>
        <p>My soul is made fresh by you</p>
        <p>And our Baath Party blossoms like a branch turns green.</p>
        <p>The medicine does not cure the ailing but the white rose does.</p>
        <p>The enemies set their plans and traps</p>
        <p>And proceeded despite the fact they are all faulty.</p>
        <p>It is a plan of arrogance and emptiness</p>
        <p>It will prove to be nothing but defeated</p>
        <p>We break it as rust devours steel</p>
        <p>Like a sinner consumed by his sins</p>
        <p>We never felt weak</p>
        <p>We were made strong by our morals.</p>
        <p>Our honorable stand, the companion of our soul,</p>
        <p>The enemies forced strangers into our sea</p>
        <p>And he who serves them will be made to weep.</p>
        <p>Here we unveil our chests to the wolves</p>
        <p>And will not tremble before the beast.</p>
        <p>We fight the most difficult challenges</p>
        <p>And beat them back, God willing.</p>
        <p>How would they fare under such strains?</p>
        <p>All people, we never let you down</p>
        <p>And in catastrophes, our party is the leader.</p>
        <p>I sacrifice my soul for you and for our nation</p>
        <p>Blood is cheap in hard times</p>
        <p>We never kneel or bend when attacking</p>
        <p>But we even treat our enemy with honor.</p>
