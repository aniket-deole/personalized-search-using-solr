        <p>A 47-year-old laborer was killed yesterday after the machine he was operating fell off a building and crashed to the ground two stories below, the police and City Building Department officials said. The accident happened around 8:30 a.m. as workers were demolishing an eight-story commercial building at 587 River Avenue. City officials said the laborer, Carlos Reinoso, of Jackson Heights, Queens, was using a Bobcat excavator to push a concrete beam over the building's side, and fell after the beam snagged the Bobcat and dragged it over the edge. The contractor, Bedroc Contracting, was issued a citation alleging unsafe practices. Bedroc's managing partner, Frank Weidner, said in a statement that his company was also looking into the accident. The police said no charges would be filed.</p>
