        <p>A 65-year-old Washington Heights man was killed in his apartment last night by a fire that residents say was started with a hair dryer left on a bed by a neighbor living one floor below him, city officials and witnesses said. Neighbors said that fire alarms in the building did not go off, so they only became aware of the fire when they felt the heat of the flames and smelled the smoke in their building, at 517 West 160th Street. The man, identified by his brother as Miguel Grullon, was pronounced dead at a hospital a short while later.</p>
