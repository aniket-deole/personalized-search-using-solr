        <p>Some waxes come off almost as easily as they go on, so it's best to apply them throughout the day on the mountain. ''In about two minutes you can make controlling your speed and motion easier,'' said Brad Nelson, the chairman of the National Ski and Snowboard Retailers Association. ''Why not do something so simple that can make an O.K. day of skiing a great one?''</p>
