        <p>Playaway is known for its Ready-to-Go line of audio book players, which are about the size of an iPod and play one book each. It is a concept that seems easy to apply to music, and that's the idea behind the company's $30 Kidz Bop to Go players, each featuring 20 songs aimed at children.</p>
        <p>The players are most notable for the features they don't have. There are no U.S.B. cables, CDs to rip or burn, downloads, online stores or batteries to recharge. Just turn them on, put in the headphones and you're ready to go.</p>

        <p>Playaway is known for its Ready-to-Go line of audio book players, which are about the size of an iPod and play one book each. It is a concept that seems easy to apply to music, and that's the idea behind the company's $30 Kidz Bop to Go players, each featuring 20 songs aimed at children.</p>
        <p>The players are most notable for the features they don't have. There are no U.S.B. cables, CDs to rip or burn, downloads, online stores or batteries to recharge. Just turn them on, put in the headphones and you're ready to go.</p>
        <p>There is a tiny LCD screen that displays the track number and time remaining. The device is powered by one AAA battery that lasts 12 hours.</p>
        <p>Volumes 1 and 2 of Kidz Bop to Go (www.playawaydigital.com) feature songs from the Kidz Bop team, who perform highly engineered versions of Top 40 songs. The sound quality is good, although the volume can get uncomfortably loud.</p>
        <p>When looking for music to keep the children entertained, consider that for the price of 30 songs from the iTunes store you can get 20 preloaded Kidz Bop selections, with the player and earbuds to boot.</p>
