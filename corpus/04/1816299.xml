        <p>Tablet PCs have not gained much traction in the marketplace, but Lenovo's latest may rev up the genre. The X60 ThinkPad Tablet has a 12-inch screen that flips around to fold flat, and it is brighter than usual, with a polarizing filter to cut glare -- perhaps for those who would walk in the sun while Web surfing. There is a stylus for writing on the touch screen, and its other end has an electronic eraser for quick deletions.</p>
        <p>The X60 is now shipping with Windows XP but can be upgraded to Vista when it arrives at the end of the month. Prices start at $1,749 for a 3.8-pound model and go as high as $4,500 for the works, including an all-day eight-cell battery, which fattens it to 4.23 pounds. An expansion base with a CD-DVD drive comes with the tablet.</p>

An expansion base with a CD-DVD drive comes with the tablet.</p>
        <p>The X60 communicates over all the current modes of Wi-Fi through an array of six antennas planted around the edges of the screen, catching a signal whatever way the tablet is held. When Wi-Fi isn't available, an optional cellular data modem can get you online if you sign up for an account.</p>
