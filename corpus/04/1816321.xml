        <p>New York Yankees are still trying to trade pitcher Randy Johnson, and may pursue first baseman Travis Lee (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Yankees continued their attempt to trade Randy Johnson yesterday, talking with multiple teams about a deal. The most likely match remains Johnson's former team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, but Arizona has not been granted a 72-hour window to speak with him. Johnson must approve a trade and it is not clear how the Diamondbacks would afford him.</p>
        <p>While the Johnson talks have absorbed most of the Yankees' attention, they have other needs. They are still interested in signing a first baseman, with Travis Lee emerging as an option if they cannot agree to terms with Doug Mientkiewicz on a one-year deal.</p>

        <p>The Yankees continued their attempt to trade Randy Johnson yesterday, talking with multiple teams about a deal. The most likely match remains Johnson's former team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, but Arizona has not been granted a 72-hour window to speak with him. Johnson must approve a trade and it is not clear how the Diamondbacks would afford him.</p>
        <p>While the Johnson talks have absorbed most of the Yankees' attention, they have other needs. They are still interested in signing a first baseman, with Travis Lee emerging as an option if they cannot agree to terms with Doug Mientkiewicz on a one-year deal.</p>
        <p>Signing Mientkiewicz is the Yankees' priority because of his exceptional glove and decent left-handed bat. Lee is also a left-hander and a strong defender, but he hit only .224 for Tampa Bay last season. He played briefly for the Yankees in 2004.</p>
        <p>Mientkiewicz had back surgery last August after hitting .283 for Kansas City. He has discussed a one-year deal with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The Yankees already have two right-handers at first base in Andy Phillips and Josh Phelps, with only one expected to make the team. If they want to add another right-handed first baseman, they could still turn to the free agent Craig Wilson, who hit .212 in 40 games for the Yankees last season.</p>
        <p>For now, the Yankees do not have a roster spot for Bernie Williams, the longtime center fielder, and they also need a backup infielder. They would also like another left-handed reliever to complement Mike Myers. They have signed the left-hander Ben Kozlowski, a minor leaguer, but have made no formal offers to veteran left-handers on the free-agent market.</p>
