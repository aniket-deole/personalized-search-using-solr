        <p>The sky was pitch black and a steady rain was falling when Mr. Spitzer arrived in Washington Park at 5:43 a.m. yesterday to keep his first campaign promise: taking a morning run through the park on his first day in office.</p>
        <p>''I have one simple question: Whose idea was this?'' Mr. Spitzer joked after he entered the lake house to cheers from friends, supporters and local residents. He marveled that old friends from college -- ''People who would never have been up this early'' -- had managed to rouse themselves from bed in the wee hours of New Year's Day.</p>

        <p>The sky was pitch black and a steady rain was falling when Mr. Spitzer arrived in Washington Park at 5:43 a.m. yesterday to keep his first campaign promise: taking a morning run through the park on his first day in office.</p>
        <p>''I have one simple question: Whose idea was this?'' Mr. Spitzer joked after he entered the lake house to cheers from friends, supporters and local residents. He marveled that old friends from college -- ''People who would never have been up this early'' -- had managed to rouse themselves from bed in the wee hours of New Year's Day.</p>
        <p>Leading a pack of more than 100 runners -- dozens of them wearing blue T-shirts with the slogan ''Day One Everything Is Changing'' -- Mr. Spitzer wound his way west along the lake; up a hill toward State Street, one of the city's most elegant and historic thoroughfares; past the Soldiers and Sailors Monument; and along a bridle path back to the lake house. The route was just short of two miles.</p>
        <p>The new governor ran in the New York City Marathon in 1983, finishing just under four hours. He said he went to bed at 1:30 a.m. yesterday after being officially sworn in and woke up when ''the internal clock started kicking in about 4:30, because I thought I'd be late'' for the run.</p>
