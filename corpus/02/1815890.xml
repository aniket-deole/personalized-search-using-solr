        <p>Dr Lydia A Bazzano, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine assistant epidemiology professor, leads study that finds vitamin B12 supplements do not help prevent strokes, heart attacks or death in people with vascular disease; suggests that life style changes do more to promote survival than B12; research is published in Journal of the American Medical Assn; drawing (M)</p>

        <p>Vitamin B12 supplements are not effective in preventing strokes, heart attacks or death in people with a history of vascular disease, a new review of studies concludes.

        <p>''We haven't found any magical supplement pills to prevent cardiovascular disease,'' said Dr. Lydia A. Bazzano, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.</p>
        <p>''The things people have to do are hard; they have to quit smoking, exercise, lose weight, eat properly,'' Dr. Bazzano continued. ''This means getting omega-3 fatty acids and a well-balanced diet in terms of carbohydrates and proteins. And eating fruits and vegetables is always good. No one has been able to contradict that yet.''</p>
        <p>The study, published in the Dec. 13 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, covered only people who were already ill with vascular disease, but the authors wrote that no randomized, controlled trials have shown a beneficial effect of B12 supplements in preventing vascular disease in healthy people, either.</p>
