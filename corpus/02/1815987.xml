        <p>Tiki Barber, mulling his post-football broadcasting job options, will not announce his intentions until after the team's postseason ends, according to his business agent, Mark Lepselter.</p>
        <p>Barber and Lepselter have been in negotiations with Disney (the owner of ABC and ESPN), Fox and NBC for the past two months. Each is interested in hiring Barber in a hybrid role, with assignments in news and sports.</p>
        <p>Lepselter said that no decision on the offers had been reached, and that the networks had not been notified of Barber's intentions.</p>
        <p>''Tiki and I have decided that we are not announcing anything until after the Giants' playoff run ends -- in February, hopefully,'' Lepselter said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''In fairness to the organization, Tiki wants his focus to be strictly on the team.''</p>
        <p>A report on the New York Post's Web site said that Barber was expected to sign a four-year, $10 million offer to work for ABC and ESPN, including roles on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' and ''20/20.'' Lepselter called the report erroneous. An ABC spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment.</p>
