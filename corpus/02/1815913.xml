        <p>FIRST VERY LIGHT JET DELIVERED -- In what some aviation industry officials believe is the dawn of a new era in aviation, the first so-called very light jet, an Eclipse 500, was delivered to a customer on Sunday by Eclipse Aviation, based in Albuquerque.</p>
        <p>Very light jets, private planes that seat four to six passengers and are being produced by a handful of manufacturers, are the lowest priced business or private jet, and are capable of using more than 5,000 noncommercial airports.</p>

        <p>FIRST VERY LIGHT JET DELIVERED -- In what some aviation industry officials believe is the dawn of a new era in aviation, the first so-called very light jet, an Eclipse 500, was delivered to a customer on Sunday by Eclipse Aviation, based in Albuquerque.</p>
        <p>Very light jets, private planes that seat four to six passengers and are being produced by a handful of manufacturers, are the lowest priced business or private jet, and are capable of using more than 5,000 noncommercial airports.</p>
        <p>Proponents say the aircraft will attract new customers to private aviation, and will be the workhorses of the air-taxi business being planned by several competitors. The Eclipse 500 cost $1.52 million in 2006.</p>
        <p>The first model was delivered to its co-owners, David Crowe and Jet-Alliance, a shared-jet operator in Westlake Village, Calif. Mr. Crowe and Jet-Alliance will share use of the plane. Eclipse said that it has 37 aircraft in various stages of assembly and has an order backlog of about 2,500.</p>
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has estimated that as many as 5,000 very light jets will be in operation within 10 years.</p>
        <p>TRANSATLANTIC BUSINESS AIRLINE -- A new discount, all-business-class transatlantic airline, L'Avion, plans to begin six-day-a-week service between Liberty International Airport in Newark and Orly in Paris.</p>
        <p>The airline will fly the route with a 757-200 aircraft outfitted with 90 business-class seats. L'Avion was taking bookings yesterday on its Web site, www.lavion.com, for flights starting tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The company offered round-trip fares of $999 for the first 1,000 customers who booked, but L'Avion said regular roundtrip fares will start at $1,599.</p>
        <p>Two all-business-class, low-fare airlines, Eos and MaxJet, began flying the New York-London Stansted routes just over a year ago, and another all-business-class low-fare start-up, Silverjet, plans to begin service between Newark and London Luton later this month.</p>
        <p>All of the start-ups offer fares sharply lower than the typical $9,000 walk-up business-class fares on most major transatlantic carriers.</p>
