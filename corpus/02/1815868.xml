        <p>HIDARY--Mariel. The Officers, Board of Trustees and Staff of the Sephardic Community Federation grieve the tragic loss of the beloved daughter of our Executive Committee Member and Trustee David &amp; Aimee Hidary and dear sister of Jack, Murray, Ricky and our Trustee Michael. During her brief 23 years, Mariel was a shining star who lit up the lives of those around her and whose brightness will be remembered by all. She touched the lives of countless young people with her warmth and sincerity and left this world a much better one through her many acts of kindness. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Hidary family--pillars of our community for generations. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem and may her memory be an inspiration to us all. Haim Dabah, Co-Chairman Ronald Tawil, Co-Chairman Sam A. Sutton, President David G. Greenfield, Executive Director</p>
