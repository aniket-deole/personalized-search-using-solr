He joined the private firm of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. in New York in 1950, becoming a General Partner in 1968 and a Limited Partner in 2001. Mr. van Hengel was an active leader in the community. As former chairman, he was an Honorary Director of Stellaris Health Network and Phelps Memorial Hospital, where he was involved in various capacities over a 30 year period. His culminating contribution was the development of a life care community with the Kendel Corporation. He was Chairman of the Kendal-onHudson Board at the time of his death. He also served as a Director of both the Netherland - America Foundation and the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce. A highlight of the many honors he was awarded for contributions to Dutch American relations was a decoration in the Queens 2004 Honour Roll as Knight in the Order of the Orange-Nassau. He is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Drusilla Drake Riley; his four children and their spouses: Maarten and Claudia van Hengel; Ginny and John Loughlin; Hugh and MaryAnn van Hengel; and Drusilla van Hengel and Joshua Patlak; and his five grandchildren; Peter, Christina, Katherine, Emily, and Riley.
