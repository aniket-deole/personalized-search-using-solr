        <p>Talk about phoning it in. President Bush's opposition to abortion is well known, but every Jan. 22, when opponents of abortion descend on Washington to protest on the anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, the president manages to be out of town, addressing protesters by telephone, not in person.</p>
        <p>Over the years, calls have come from Camp David, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico and West Virginia. The exception was 2001, when the protest fell on Mr. Bush's first official workday as president. That year, he sent a statement, read by Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey.</p>
