        <p>A 21-year-old Hunter College student was killed yesterday in a fall from the rooftop of a 20-story college building on East 67th Street near Lexington Avenue, the police said. The student, Anton Frolov of Brooklyn, had been escorted from the roof moments before by security guards responding to an alarm that sounded when he went outside, the police said. But minutes later, he went back outside, the police said, and fell before the guards returned. The police said they were investigating the possibility that he had jumped. The student's landing was so loud that 911 callers reported the sound of gunfire or an exploding bomb, the police said. David Sanchez, 45, a custodian in the building, said, ''I was inside on the first floor taking care of the trash when I heard a big bang, like a really loud noise.''</p>
