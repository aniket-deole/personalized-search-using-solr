        <p>A young woman found dead on Sunday under a pile of trash has been identified as Illeana Hess, 17, of Toms River, Thomas F. Kelaher, the Ocean County prosecutor, said yesterday. Ms. Hess was last seen alive by her father on Dec. 31 at her home on Morris Avenue and had been reported missing, said Capt. Jeff Harper of the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office. Ms. Hess's body was discovered near 3 p.m. Sunday by a man scavenging through garbage in a wooded area near Dover Road. The body showed no signs of trauma, Captain Harper said. He added that because Ms. Hess was buried under trash, ''it appears she was put there.'' Her death is considered suspicious, he said, and a toxicology report is pending.</p>
