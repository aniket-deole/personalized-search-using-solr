        <p>A Bronx teenager was indicted on murder charges yesterday in two deaths, including the contract killing of a drug dealer as part of a turf war over drug sales, the Bronx district attorney's office announced. The teenager, Alan Brown, 18, is charged with shooting Shawron Hughes, who prosecutors said was a drug dealer, as Mr. Hughes was driving in Fordham on July 7, 2005. Mr. Hughes lost control of his car, which struck and killed a bystander, Wellington Contrera. Mr. Hughes, who was shot in the head, did not die until Oct. 19, 2006. Prosecutors said that Mr. Brown had been hired by Terrance Degraffenreid, 33, to kill Mr. Hughes for $2,000. A second man, who has not been identified and who the authorities said was still at large, was also involved in hiring Mr. Brown, prosecutors said. Mr. Degraffenreid faces first-degree murder and other charges, prosecutors said, and a third man, Duane Heath, 19, faces conspiracy and weapons charges.</p>
