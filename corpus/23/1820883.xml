        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Other Losing War,'' by Orlando Patterson (column, Jan. 13), implies that President Richard M. Nixon's efforts against drug abuse exclusively attacked their supply. To the contrary, in 1970 Nixon's President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization urged much greater emphasis on demand reduction and proposed the creation of a new drug abuse treatment, education and research administration.</p>
        <p>In 1971 Nixon established within the White House the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention to aggressively address drug demand. A few years later when the National Institute on Drug Abuse was established, it absorbed the demand reduction responsibilities of the Special Action Office.</p>

        <p>The writer was on the staff of the President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization in 1970.</p>
