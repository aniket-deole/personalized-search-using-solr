Newman, beloved mother of our dear colleague and esteemed director Robert G.

        <p>$(6$)NEWMAN--Eva E. The entire Continuum Health Partners and Beth Israel Medical Center community acknowledges with sadness the passing of our dear friend and valiant supporter, Eva E.

To Bob and his wife, Seiko, Bob's brothers Tim and Steve, Eva's grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and the entire Newman family, we extend our most heartfelt condolences. She will be remembered always. Morton P. Hyman Chairman of Trustees Continuum and Beth Israel. Stanley Brezenoff President and CEO Continuum. David J. Shulkin, M. D.
