        <p>The Supreme Court decision on Monday that invalidated California's criminal sentencing law would probably affect only a small slice of the state's convicted felon population.</p>
        <p>Over 90 percent of criminal cases here are resolved in plea agreements, which would be immune to challenges. Further, felons sentenced to life terms and those convicted under the state's three-strikes law would not be able to argue for an adjusted sentence.</p>
        <p>But in a state with 173,000 inmates, thousands could be affected, lawmakers and criminal justice experts said, as they worked to puzzle out what the court's ruling meant and how to address it legislatively.</p>
        <p>''We are very disappointed today,'' David LaBahn, the executive director of the California District Attorneys Association, said of the court's decision that the 30-year-old sentencing law gave judges authority that the Constitution places with juries. Mr. LaBahn added that prosecutors in the state would now move to force jury trials over plea bargains in some criminal cases.</p>
        <p>''Will that slow down the trials?'' Mr. LaBahn said, ''Yes it will. Will there be arguments between prosecutors and defense lawyers over bifurcating the trial and sentencing portion? Yes. Some judges are going to be grumpy because it will add court days, but our folks will do what is right and just.''</p>
        <p>The ruling comes at a time when the state's Legislature is trying to come up with a solution to the problem of crowding in the state's prisons. Both Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Senate majority leader have proposed establishing a sentencing commission to address the issue.</p>
        <p>The governor issued a statement saying that his office was trying to determine the impact of the ruling, adding: ''I support longer sentences for criminals who deserve them. As governor, I will work to ensure that this decision will not be a threat to public safety.''</p>
