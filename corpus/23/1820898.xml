        <p>The House of Representatives plans to vote this week on a measure to deny a federal pension to any current or future member of Congress convicted of a serious crime in office. The Senate has passed a similar bill. The measure would not strip pensions from former members who are already collecting them, including Bob Ney of Ohio and Randy Cunningham of California, both of whom have been sentenced in corruption cases. According to a tally by Senator John Kerry, who sponsored the Senate version of the bill, since 1980 at least 26 lawmakers have been convicted of crimes.</p>

        <p>Correction:  January 24, 2007, Wednesday  A chart with the Political Action column yesterday listing the estimated federal pensions of former lawmakers who have been convicted of crimes misstated the party affiliation of former Representative James Traficant of Ohio. He was a Democrat, not a Republican.</p>
