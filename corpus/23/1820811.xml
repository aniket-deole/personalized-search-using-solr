        <p>When federal and state officials began trying to limit sedative prescriptions for the elderly nearly two decades ago, the expectation was that doctors would see fewer hip fractures in their frail patients.</p>
        <p>But a new study  suggests that it has not worked out that way. Writing in the current Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers say the regulations appear to have done little to reduce the injuries and should be reconsidered.</p>
        <p>The question is important because a hip fracture in an older person can lead to serious disability and even death. Some researchers have suggested that the sedatives, known as benzodiazepines, may cause falls by making people unsteady on their feet.</p>
        <p>The authors of the new study, led by Anita K. Wagner of the department of ambulatory care and prevention at Harvard Medical School, looked at what happened when New York State adopted rules intended to discourage doctors from prescribing the sedatives too often. Beginning in 1989, doctors had to use special triplicate prescription pads for the drugs, with one copy sent to the state.</p>
        <p>In almost no time, benzodiazepine prescriptions dropped by more than half among many patients.</p>
        <p>Other states have also taken steps to reduce sedative use, and the Medicare drug plan refuses to pay for them.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Wagner and her colleagues found that in New York, at least, the rate of hip fractures among the patients who were looked at did not change in the 21 months after the rules were passed.</p>
        <p>A study co-author, Stephen B. Soumerai, said the rules were hurting patients. ''Used appropriately for anxiety and sleep,'' Dr. Soumerai said, ''these drugs are O.K., and they really improve quality of life.''</p>
