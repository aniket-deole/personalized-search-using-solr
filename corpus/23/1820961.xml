        <p>Government investigators looking into the cause of the midair collision over the Amazon in September that killed 154 people aboard a civilian airliner said for the first time that air traffic controllers were partly to blame. Previously, the authorities had assigned responsibility solely to the two American pilots of the other plane, an executive jet that managed to make an emergency landing without loss of life. The controllers ''should have adopted emergency procedures'' when the smaller plane could not be located on their radar screens, ''but that was not done,'' said Renato Sayão, the chief investigator.</p>
