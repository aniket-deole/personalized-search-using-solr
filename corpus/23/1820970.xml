        <p>In a statement released yesterday, the lawyer for a Hoboken councilman charged on Saturday with drunken driving in Manhattan said his client ''realizes this was a lapse in judgment and admits he made a mistake.'' The councilman, Christopher Campos, 30, left, who is also a prosecutor in West New York, was charged with driving while intoxicated after he ran a red light on the West Side Highway at 43rd Street about 3 a.m., the police said. Yesterday, his lawyer, Francis S. Cutruzzula, released a statement in which he said Mr. Campos acknowledged that he had made a mistake ''and wants to assure everyone that this will never happen again.'' A spokesman for David Roberts, the mayor of Hoboken, said that the mayor was ''supportive'' of Mr. Campos and did not believe that the councilman would need to resign. Mr. Campos did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.</p>
