        <p>Correction:  January 24, 2007, Wednesday  An article on Friday about the Pentagon's new rules for military commissions to try prisoners held at Guantánamo, Cuba, on terrorism charges, misstated the reasons cited by the Supreme Court when it struck down the Bush administration's original plans for the commissions. And a correction in this space yesterday repeated the error. The court ruled last year in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the initial procedures established for the commissions were unauthorized by federal statute and violated international law. It did not rule that the commissions themselves were unconstitutional.</p>
