        <p>As his health grew worse, Pope John Paul II discussed with top aides the possibility of resigning in 2000, Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, his personal secretary for 40 years, says in a new book. Among those he consulted was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI after John Paul died in 2005. John Paul ''came to the conclusion that he had to submit to God's will, that is, to remain as long as God wanted,'' Cardinal Dziwisz wrote in the book, called ''A Life With Karol,'' the pope's given name.</p>
