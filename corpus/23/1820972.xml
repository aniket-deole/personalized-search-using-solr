        <p>The former music director of Christ Church in Greenwich pleaded guilty yesterday in Federal District Court to possession of child pornography, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. Assuring the court that he would check himself into a medical center pending sentencing, the former director, Robert F. Tate, was released after posting a $500,000 bond secured by rental property he owns in Stamford and the pledge of several supporters who agreed to cover the balance. Prosecutors told the court that they confiscated electronic materials that contained 150 to 300 sexually explicit images of young children from Mr. Tate's housing at the Episcopal church. Asked by Judge Alan H. Nevas whether he was pleading guilty because he was guilty, Mr. Tate, 64, said that ''sad to say, I am.'' A woman whose husband co-signed the bond, Evelyn Bausman, told a reporter that she believed Mr. Tate's admission of guilt. Asked then why she stood by him, she said, ''Well, we're all sinners.''</p>
