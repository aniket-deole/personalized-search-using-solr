        <p>''The Higher Power of Lucky,'' by Susan Patron, has won the 2007 John Newbery Medal, the most prestigious award in children's literature. The prize was announced yesterday by the American Library Association at its midwinter meeting in Seattle. The book, the story of a scrappy orphan who searches for a higher power in her small, dusty California town, was published by Atheneum/Richard Jackson Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. The Randolph Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished children's picture book was awarded to David Wiesner for ''Flotsam,'' the story of a little boy who embarks on a photographic adventure at the beach. It was published by Clarion Books, an imprint of Houghton Mifflin. Publishers place a high value on the literary awards, signified by silver and gold seals on the covers of award-winning books.</p>
