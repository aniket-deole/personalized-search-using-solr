        <p>The enchantment with a school of dolphins, feeding and frolicking in the local bays north of here last week, has turned to alarm, after four of them died over the weekend and the others grew increasingly sluggish and showed signs of distress.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, a week after perhaps 30 dolphins first entered the bays on the northern part of Long Island's south fork , rescuers began efforts to save a group in a small, shallow cove in Northwest Harbor.</p>
        <p>All three attempts to drive the dolphins out to deeper waters in Gardiners Bay and eventually the ocean on Sunday were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Through thick fog, several boats tried to herd the dolphins by using small devices, called pingers for the high-frequency sound they produce, towed in the water. Each time they neared the harbor's narrow outlet, nearby sandbars and shallows, they panicked and retreated back to the deeper cove.</p>
        <p>''It's like trying to push them over a fence,'' said Chuck Hamilton, a regional supervisor for New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>He called the next few days critical for the dolphins' survival, because expected cold weather might make them more nervous and rough seas would hinder further rescue attempts.</p>
        <p>More than 80 dolphin rescuers, including a crew with a dolphin ambulance, were in the harbor on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Officials said that the dolphins were lured to the local bays by warm water and by abundant baitfish, a food source that now appears to be depleted.</p>
        <p>Necropsy results on the dead dolphins were not yet available and the cause of their deaths was still unclear. But Mr. Hamilton said: ''We haven't seen any evidence'' of the dolphins' eating on Saturday or Sunday.</p>
