        <p>GREENBERG--Milton, Laur, 88, died suddenly and peacefully on January 12th, 2007 at the California Veterans Home in Yountville, after having Parkinson's for 12 years. He lived in Port Chester and Rye, NY and Santa Rosa, CA. He was an Air Transport Command navigator in WWII; a manufacturers representative of high-temperature boilers for International Boiler Works; and at 55 got the first Bachelors of Family Therapy from Antioch College, and then a Masters of Family Therapy from Hahnemann Medical College in Phillidelphia. He was a family co-therapist with his wife in Rye, and retired to Santa Rosa 21 years ago. He had a way of summing up his world in a word or two which at the same time captured its essence and had incredible humor. His final gift was his brain to the Parkinson's Institute for research. The world is a better place for his having lived in it. Married 63 years, he is survived by his wife Alice, his sons David of Portland, OR, and Carl of Spokane, WA, grandchildren Sarah, Jacob, Emily, Seth, and several nephews and nieces including Samuel and Eleanor Sipkins.</p>
