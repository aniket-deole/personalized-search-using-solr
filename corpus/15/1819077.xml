        <p>Dora E. McDonald, who served as secretary and confidante to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the most turbulent years of the civil rights movement, died on Saturday. She was 81.</p>
        <p>The cause was complications from cancer, said the Rev. Betsy Lunz, the minister of pastoral care at Ms. McDonald's church.</p>
        <p>Ms. McDonald was viewed as a rock of serenity in the 1960s, as Dr. King and his lieutenants were preaching, marching and getting arrested. She was with the King family in Oslo when Dr. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, and in 1968 she was the first to tell Coretta Scott King of her husband's assassination.</p>
        <p>Dora Edith McDonald was born in Sumter, S.C., never married and had no surviving close relatives, said several people who knew her.</p>
        <p>She worked first for Benjamin Mays, the president of historically black Morehouse College, then in 1960 went to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to work for Dr. King. After his death, she was secretary to Andrew Young, the civil rights leader and politician. Before Mrs. King's death, Ms. McDonald assisted her part time, said Christine King Farris, Dr. King's sister.</p>
        <p>''She was just like one of our family,'' Ms. Farris said.</p>
        <p>Ms. McDonald wrote in a coming memoir, ''Secretary to a King: Martin Luther King Jr., the Movement and Me,'' of the excitement of working for Dr. King: ''After I got into my job and what I was doing -- what we were doing -- and what the movement meant, I never wanted to be doing anything else.''</p>
        <p>''I was a part of something momentous; it was a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week position.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McDonald typed Dr. King's speeches and manuscripts and kept up with his torrential correspondence. ''Archivally, I know quite well,'' said David Garrow, a King biographer, ''an awful lot of the letters that people received around the world signed by Dr. Martin Luther King were actually signed by Dora McDonald.''</p>
