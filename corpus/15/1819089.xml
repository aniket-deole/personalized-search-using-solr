        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Status Quo Secretary General'' (editorial, Jan. 6):</p>
        <p>From a gender equality perspective, the new secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has challenged the status quo by appointing two highly qualified women from developing countries to key positions: Asha-Rose Mtengeti-Migiro, former foreign minister of Tanzania, to the No. 2 position of deputy secretary general, and Alicia BÃ¡rcena Ibarra of Mexico to the post of under secretary general for management.</p>
        <p>The secretary general pledged to appoint women to half of the top Secretariat positions. As an organization that has spearheaded a global 50-50 campaign to promote women in decision making, including at the United Nations, we have heard such pledges before.</p>
        <p>But based on his initial appointments, this secretary general may be on his way to setting a record that begins to approach gender parity at the highest levels of the United Nations, a goal that eluded his predecessor. Such an achievement should be applauded, not ignored.</p>
