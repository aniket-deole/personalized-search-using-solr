        <p>RUBIN--Sylvia Seiderman, 94, our mother and wife, died on January 13, 2007 in Miami Beach, Florida. Born in Brooklyn, she was the daughter of the late prominent Brooklyn Democratic leader and lawyer, Samuel Seiderman and his wife Ella. In dying as in life, she was a woman of remarkable strength and uncompromising integrity. She is survived by her husband of 73 years, attorney Alexander Rubin and her children Robert E. Rubin (Judy), the former Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton, and Jane Zirin, M.D. She is also survived by her grandchildren Jamie (Gretchen), Philip (Lauren), Annie (Jason), David (Michele) and her greatgranddaughters Eliza, Eleanor, Sasha and Amira. Sylvia also leaves behind her many beloved friends, who have supported each other for many, many years. A special thanks to Dr. Joseph Pizzolato and Dr. Amiel Levin for their competence and kindness. Last but not least, we thank our ''team''-Tina, Estelle and Heather -for their devotion and care. Services were held. For information RIVESIDE GORDON MEMORIAL CHAPELS, 305531-1151.</p>
