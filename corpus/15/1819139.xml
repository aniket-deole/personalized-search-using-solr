        <p>Budget watchers should also take note. Mr. Balboni said that when he recently presented his preliminary wish list to the budget director, Paul Francis, he was told things were going to be tight. When he asked how tight, Mr. Francis said, ''tighter than you've ever seen,'' Mr. Balboni recalled.</p>
