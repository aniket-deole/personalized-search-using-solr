        <p>A church van packed with parishioners, most of them children, and a car collided yesterday, sending about a dozen people to the hospital with minor injuries, the police and witnesses said. The van, a Ford Club Wagon, was traveling east on 14th Avenue about 3:30 p.m. when the collision occurred with the car, a red Chrysler, which was turning onto the avenue from South 14th Street, the police and witnesses said. The parishioners were returning from Sunday services at Greater Work of Apostolic Ministry in neighboring East Orange. The police did not release the names of the injured or the hospitals to which they were transported, but said none of the injuries were life threatening.</p>
