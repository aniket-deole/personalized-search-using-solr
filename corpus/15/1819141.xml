        <p>A 28-year-old woman was fatally stabbed in the chest early yesterday during a small party in her Tremont apartment building, the police said. The woman, identified by neighbors as Carolyn Vargas, left, lived on the first floor of the building with her 4-month-old daughter. She was friendly with two men who lived together on the fourth floor, neighbors said. The neighbors said the police were trying to find one of the men yesterday, showing his picture to residents around the building. David Buggs, a neighbor who added two candles to a memorial that included more than two dozen by nightfall, said that around midnight Saturday he heard Ms. Vargas arguing with the two men outside, but that afterward all three went back upstairs together. The police arrived about 2:15 a.m., he said. ''They brought her down on a stretcher. Blood was dripping off and she was strapped down,'' Mr. Buggs said. ''I asked the cop if she'd be all right, but he said he didn't think so.'' Ms. Vargas was pronounced dead a short time later at St. Barnabas Hospital.</p>
