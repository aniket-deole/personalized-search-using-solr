        <p>A group of black and Latino police officers have accused the Police Department of singling some of them out for harassment by noting, in their personnel files, which officers were part of a 1999 discrimination lawsuit. Several officers who have reviewed their files recently found notes identifying them as complainants in the discrimination suit against the department, which the city settled for $26.8 million in 2004, said the officers' lawyer, Norman Siegel. The notes effectively label them as troublemakers and could hamper their chances for promotions or transfers, he said at a news conference yesterday with members of the National Latino Officers Association of America and 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care. A spokesman for the department, Chief Michael Collins, declined to comment.</p>
