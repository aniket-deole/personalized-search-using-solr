        <p>The parents of a 2-month-old Harlem boy who died on Saturday were charged with murder yesterday after they told detectives they had shaken and hit him to stop his crying, the police said.</p>
        <p>When the boy, Sebastian Flores, finally fell quiet, his parents believed he had fallen asleep, according to a complaint filed by the district attorney's office. Hours later, they awoke to discover he was not breathing, and called 911. He was pronounced dead at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>''This was a tragic, violent murder,'' said Robert Hettleman, an assistant district attorney who appeared last night at the arraignment of the parents, Teresa Flores, 20, and Rufino Bedoya-Flores, 30, in Manhattan Criminal Court. He said both had abused the child, the product of an unwanted pregnancy. They were charged with second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child.</p>
        <p>They had been living with Sebastian -- whom the police first identified as Demetro Flores -- Ms. Flores's 1-year-old daughter and several other people in an apartment on West 135th Street.</p>
        <p>James McQueeney, a lawyer for Mr. Bedoya-Flores, described both defendants as ''hard-working, poor people,'' adding, ''I think they cared deeply about the child who died.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Flores's daughter has been taken from the home by child welfare officials, who were trying to locate her father, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Last night the precise cause of the baby's death had not been determined, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the chief medical examiner.</p>
        <p>Around 4:30 a.m. Saturday, Ms. Flores, awakened by the infant's crying, hit him and shook him forcefully, according to the district attorney's complaint. She placed her hand over his nose and mouth and pressed a bedsheet hard against his neck, according to the complaint.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flores screamed at the baby, the complaint said, before Mr. Bedoya-Flores took him from her, hitting and shaking him hard.</p>
