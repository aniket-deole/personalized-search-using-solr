        <p>A 30-year-old man and his 21-year-old female companion were found fatally shot yesterday in an apartment in Sunnyside. The police believe the man shot the woman before turning a gun on himself. The woman's mother, who lived with her daughter in the apartment on 49th Street, discovered the two shot in the head about 7 p.m. A .22-caliber gun was found near the man, whose name was not immediately released pending family notification, the police said. The woman, Gabriella Alcivir, had requested a restraining order against the man after she said he assaulted her in September, a law enforcement official said. But the two had since reconciled, the official said.</p>
