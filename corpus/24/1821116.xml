        <p>Lillian Roberts was overwhelmingly elected to a new three-year term as executive director of District Council 37, the city's largest union of municipal workers, the union announced last night. The union's 327-member delegate assembly, in weighted voting, elected Ms. Roberts with 83,486 votes, while the challenger, Charles Ensley, president of the union local representing social workers, received 37,503 votes. In her race three years ago, Ms. Roberts eked out a victory over Mr. Ensley. After three years in which the executive board often clashed with Ms. Roberts, her slate swept all 20 contested seats on the board yesterday, giving her firm control.</p>
