        <p>Attorney General Greg Abbott filed an agreed judgment against a Dallas company that was marketing a mothball-like product as a gas-mileage booster. The company, BioPerformance, sold its product with a claim that putting a couple of the pills into an automobile fuel tank could increase gas mileage 30 percent. The state's investigation revealed that the product had no such power and that its main ingredient was naphthalene, used in making mothballs. The state also found that the company developed a pyramid scheme that drew in about 50,000 people nationwide and ran up some $28 million in sales. The judgment provides $7.3 million in restitution to affected consumers.</p>
