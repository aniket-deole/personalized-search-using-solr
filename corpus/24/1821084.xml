        <p>Correction of Jan 14 DealBook on what some chief executives say during takeover battles, which referred incompletely to position of Delta Air Lines and its chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, on merger proposals</p>

        <p>The DealBook column on Jan.14 in Sunday Business, about what some chief executives say during takeover battles, referred incompletely to the position of Delta Air Lines and its chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, on merger proposals. As the column noted, Delta has rejected a takeover offer from US Airways and says that it wants to come out of bankruptcy as an independent airline. Yet it has also been privately talking with Northwest Airlines. While Mr. Grinstein had not publicly commented on reports of the talks with Northwest until yesterday, he had indeed said that Delta had a fiduciary duty to consider all alternatives, including mergers.</p>
