        <p>Lisa E. Goldberg, president of the Charles H. Revson Foundation, died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 54.</p>
        <p>The cause was a brain aneurysm, said a spokesman for New York University, of which her husband, John Sexton, is president.</p>
        <p>In 1982, Ms. Goldberg started as a program officer at the foundation, which has an endowment of $180 million and makes grants in fields including urban affairs and education. Under her leadership, the foundation financed two Public Broadcasting System series, ''Genesis: A Living Conversation,'' with Bill Moyers, and ''Eyes on the Prize.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Ellen Goldberg was born in Brookline, Mass., on May 1, 1952, and graduated from Radcliffe and Harvard Law School. Past jobs included being a senior staff member and legal counsel of the President's Commission for a National Agenda for the '80s in the Carter administration.</p>
        <p>In addition to her husband, Ms. Goldberg is survived by their daughter, Katherine Lodgen Sexton, and their son, Jed Sexton, both of Manhattan; three granddaughters; her sister, Donna Eskind of Nashville; and her brother, Philip S. Goldberg, the United States ambassador to Bolivia.</p>
