        <p>8 P.M. (13, 49) RHINOCEROS Virtually unchanged over 25 million years, the rhinoceros once roamed the earth in millions. Today, it is one of the planet's rarest animals, with three of the remaining five species headed toward extinction. This ''Nature'' special follows rangers through the savannahs of South Africa, the grasslands of India and the jungles of Indonesia to examine efforts to protect rhinos from poachers and relocate them to new habitats, and peers into a fertility lab at an American zoo to find out about attempts to breed them in captivity. It also zooms in on some startling behavior in the rhinos' natural environments, including a nursery full of mothers and calves and a charge from an angry bull.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (BET) CELEBRATION OF GOSPEL '07 Steve Harvey gets spiritual as host of this evening of rafter-raising inspirational music from the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles.

Lou Gossett Jr., Quincy Jones, Blair Underwood, Gabrielle Union, Loretta Devine, Idris Elba, Derek Luke and Keke Palmer are among the presenters. The show also features a tribute to Tyler Perry for his work in gospel-themed urban theater.</p>
