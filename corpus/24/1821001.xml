        <p>SIMONS--Benjamin, 84. On January 22nd. Husband of his beloved Matilda Cohen Simons for 60 years. Born in NYC to Clara and Joseph Simons. Ben attended the NY High School of Printing, but left school early to join the army's 2nd Infantry Division Indianheads, joining the forces on D-Day and fighting in France, Germany, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia. He returned to New York to marry Matilda and raise his daughters Deborah Yoburn (David) and Jacqueline Kidd (Richard), and he returned to HS Printing, where he taught for 27 years. Moving to Yonkers, he helped establish the Greystone Jewish Center, where he was a president of B'nai Brith, Greystone Lodge. Benjamin's greatest legacy is his loving daughters, and his adoring grandchildren, Joshua, Jesse (Tewlyn), Jason, Jamie, and Marni. Ben is also survived by his brother Marvin. Ben was a kind and gentle man, beloved and admired by all who knew him, and will be deeply missed.</p>
