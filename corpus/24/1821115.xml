        <p>The first scheduled helicopter service to New York area airports from the East Side in two decades is set to begin next month, aviation officials said yesterday. The helicopter company, U.S. Helicopter Corporation, which provides eight-minute flights from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport to Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport, said it would add service to those two airports from the city-owned East 34th Street Heliport on Feb. 5. The East Side heliport, like the downtown heliport, will have security screening overseen by the federal Transportation Security Administration that will allow passengers to bypass the security lines at the airports. The one-way fare will be $169.</p>
