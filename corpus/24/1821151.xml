        <p>WHITHER MONTRACHET?</p>
        <p>This TriBeCa pioneer closed for renovations in early summer but has not reopened. Last week Drew Nieporent, an owner, said he was not ready to discuss his plans for the restaurant, which opened in 1985 with David Bouley in the kitchen and soon received three stars from Bryan Miller in The New York Times. It received two stars in its most recent review, in 2004. It is listed in the 2007 Zagat guide with a note about the renovations, and is on the Zagat Web site with the advisory, ''call ahead.'' But calls to the restaurant have gone unanswered: 239 West Broadway (White Street), (212) 219-2777.</p>
        <p>OPEN NOW</p>
        <p>AD HOC -- This was supposed to have been a seasonal restaurant, in business only part of the year. But Thomas Keller's comfort food has proven so popular that he will now keep it open year round: 6476 Washington Street, Yountville, Calif., (707) 944-2487.</p>
        <p>BARCIBO ENOTECA -- The owners of Bin 71 on Columbus Avenue have opened this larger Italian-accented wine bar nearby: 2020 Broadway (69th Street), (212) 595-2805.</p>
        <p>BLACK PEARL -- It took Greg Ryan, David Leonard and Brian Woods more than a year to find a new location after they closed their seafood spot, in the back of a bar in the East Village. Now it's spacious, with a loft-meets-shack look. The specialty is lobster rolls ($22.50), filled with buttery chunks. Another roll is piled with crisply fried tiny fresh Maine shrimp ($14.95): 37 West 26th Street, (212) 532-9900.</p>
        <p>LOOKING AHEAD</p>
        <p>THE INN LW12 -- With Daniel Boulud on board to oversee the kitchen, Jeffrey Jah and Lyman Carter plan to open this gastro-pub next month. The ground floor will be informal, with a dressier room, the Canoe Club, upstairs. Andy Bennett, who worked with Mr. Boulud in New York and with Raymond Blanc in England, will put an international spin on the menu: 7 Ninth Avenue (Little West 12th Street), no phone.</p>
        <p>WILD SALMON -- Jeffrey Chodorow will close English Is Italian on March 17 and turn it into a restaurant featuring the food of the Pacific Northwest. Charles Ramseyer, who was the chef at Ray's Boathouse in Seattle, will be the chef when it opens in the spring, in time for the first Copper River salmon: 622 Third Avenue (40th Street), (212) 404-1700.</p>
