        <p>Justice Carol Berkman of New York State Supreme Court in New York City holds defense lawyer Laura Miranda in contempt and fines her $1,000 after she fails to appear for second day at trial of Paul Cortez for murder of Catherine Woods in 2005 (S)</p>

        <p>A judge presiding over a murder trial in State Supreme Court held a lawyer in contempt yesterday and fined her $1,000 after she failed to appear on behalf of her client, Paul Cortez, for the second straight day. Jury selection was supposed to begin Monday in the trial of Mr. Cortez, 25, who is charged with murdering Catherine Woods, 21, a dancer, in her Upper East Side apartment in 2005. Justice Carol Berkman said Mr. Cortez's lawyer, Laura Miranda, sent the court a fax on Monday, saying that she had to go to Puerto Rico to take care of her sick mother. ''For what illness, I do not know,'' Justice Berkman said. The fax said Ms. Miranda's co-counsel, Dawn Florio, had had a death in the family. The judge said Ms. Miranda had been absent without leave from her courtroom before. ''Well, I suppose we may as well adjourn this matter until tomorrow and see whether indeed she reappears,'' the judge said.</p>
