        <p>Two Long Island boys returning home from school yesterday discovered that their parents had been killed in what investigators believed was a double homicide, the Nassau County police said.</p>
        <p>The parents, Jaspal and Geeta Singh, had been fatally shot, the police said. Investigators said last night that they had no motive or suspects for the killings. The police had no reports of domestic violence from the house, said Detective Lt. Kevin Smith.</p>
        <p>The boys -- Josh, 13, and Ankur, 12 -- got off the school bus yesterday and rang the doorbell of their home on Doone Drive in Syosset, the police said. When no one answered, they used a hidden spare key to enter the two-story home, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mike Moore, 13, who had gotten off the school bus with the two boys, said that within minutes, Ankur ran across the street and asked someone to call 911.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'My dad's on the floor, and he's not breathing or anything,' '' said Mike, who attends Thompson Middle School with the two boys. The father's body was in the living room while the mother's body was in a bedroom, Mike said Ankur told him.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Oh my God, I can't believe my parents just died,' '' Mike said. The boys cried while they waited for the police. Mike said that Ankur kept saying, ''I didn't even get to say goodbye.''</p>
        <p>The family had moved from New York City to Syosset, known for its high-quality schools, within the past year, neighbors said. Mr. Singh, 46, owned two small retail businesses; Ms. Singh, 38, did not work.</p>
