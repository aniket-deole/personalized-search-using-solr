        <p>After looters continued to carry away motorcycles, engine parts, alcohol and other goods from containers on a Devon beach after a cargo ship foundered and was grounded off the coast, the authorities said they would prosecute anyone who did not report and return the items. ''Frankly, the scenes were despicable,'' Mark Rodaway, an official at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said at a news conference. He said looters had compounded damage to the beach while making it harder for coastal officials to deal with issues like contamination from 200 tons of heavy fuel said to have leaked from the ship, the Napoli. Environmentalists said 1,100 oil-covered birds -- about 900 guillemots and 200 gulls -- had already washed up on shore.</p>
