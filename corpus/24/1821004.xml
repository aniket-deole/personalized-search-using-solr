        <p>VELAY--Frances A. An engaged philanthropist deeply committed to environmental concerns, particularly conservation of the Oceans and marine life, preservation of endangered species, especially her beloved turtles, and the prevention of cruelty to animals, Frances A. Velay, 92, died peacefully at her home in Philadelphia on Saturday, January 20, 2007. Born in France on November 25, 1914 to Dora and Maxime Adolphe Velay, she received her License SC at the University of Paris before moving to New York to earn her MS in Chemistry from New York University in 1947, continuing studies toward a Ph.D at a time when few women pursued graduate work in science; she also studied philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School and abroad. Later, Ms. Velay proudly became a United States citizen. Art and music were her avocations; she exhibited her pastels in Philadelphia and Oklahoma City where she lived for a few years and was a violinist with the Landsdowne Symphony Orchestra and other community orchestras in Philadelphia and Washington DC. In addition to her environmental concerns, she worked often through her two foundations, Panaphil and Uphill, to strengthen civic organizations in her adopted city of Philadelphia as well as to control global population, protect human rights and end discrimination, to support programs to enable individuals to help themselves, promote literacy, provide medical services to the underserved and sustain the arts. Predeceased by her brother, Gerard Velay, she is survived by her brother, Clement Velay, her sister, Dorrance Velay d'Audre, four nieces and nephews, namely Mireille Velay Turpin, Christophe Velay, Aude Velay and Philippe Velay, and by ten great-nieces and nephews and one great-great-niece. After a private funeral at Greenwood Cemetery, a memorial reception will be held at The University Club 1 West 54th Street in Manhattan on Wednesday, January 24, 2007 at noon.</p>
