        <p>Human Rights Watch accused the government of colluding with Karuna, a renegade faction of the Tamil Tiger rebels, in rounding up children to fight against their former comrades. While the Tigers have long been accused of conscripting child soldiers, the rights group said the government was implicated in some of the same abuse by using the renegade group as a ''proxy force.'' The government denied both charges. Its report, based on interviews with parents and children, said that Karuna operated with impunity in government-controlled areas and that its abductions of hundreds of boys and young men were carried out in areas with a heavy military presence.</p>
