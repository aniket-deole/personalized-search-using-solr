      <abstract>
        <p>William Guy and John Groff letters on Nicholas D Kristof's comparison of Pres Bush to Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick in his obsessiveness (Jan 23 Op-Ed column); Guy says Bush's obsession has been Saddam Hussein, not specter of another 9/11; Groff says Bush lacks Ahab's heroic stature; James F McManus III, commenting on Kristof's reference to Athens's disastrous Syracuse adventure, says US will not suffer similar military catastrophe but will founder on gargantuan, unpayable debt incurred to run war and pay for social programs and tax cuts</p>

        <p>If we are to explore President Bush's behavior in terms of Captain Ahab in ''Moby-Dick,'' as Nicholas D. Kristof urges (''Et Tu, George?,'' column, Jan. 23), then surely the white whale is Saddam Hussein, and not the desire to prevent another terrorist attack.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>If we are to explore President Bush's behavior in terms of Captain Ahab in ''Moby-Dick,'' as Nicholas D. Kristof urges (''Et Tu, George?,'' column, Jan. 23), then surely the white whale is Saddam Hussein, and not the desire to prevent another terrorist attack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush arrived in office already obsessed with Saddam Hussein and went on to twist his policy and warp the whole world to get him. Absurdly inappropriate motives of family revenge and infantile fantasies from cowboy movies were in play: Saddam Hussein had tried to assassinate the first President Bush and so the second felt free to involve nations, armies and societies in his vendetta.</p>
        <p>A terrible triviality was at work here, which Melville's tragic vision might have done much to correct and caution against, but reading lists (much flaunted now) seem to have come too late for this president -- to our loss.</p>
        <p>William Guy  Pittsburgh, Jan. 23, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re Nicholas D. Kristof's comparison of George W. Bush to Melville's Captain Ahab: I made exactly that comparison to a friend at lunch the other day, but I said, ''He's like Ahab without the grandeur.''</p>
        <p>Please, let's remember that. Ahab towers in his monomania. This guy doesn't. He's Ahab writ small.</p>
        <p>John Groff  Simsbury, Conn., Jan. 23, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Nicholas D. Kristof makes an apt comparison between the Athenians' disaster at Syracuse during the Peloponnesian Wars and our war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>We're not likely to meet with a military catastrophe as Athens did, though. We'll founder on the gargantuan, unpayable debt we've incurred to run the war and pay for our social programs and tax cuts.</p>
        <p>James F. McManus III  Phoenix, Jan. 23, 2007</p>
