        <p>After a six-week hiatus, the return of NBC's ''Heroes'' Monday relegated Fox's ''24'' to second place in the 9 p.m. ratings. According to Nielsen's estimates, ''Heroes'' led ''24'' by 20 percent among adults 18 to 49, and had 14.8 million viewers, compared to 14.4 million for ''24.'' NBC ranked first for the night in the 18-to-49 set as its game show ''Deal or No Deal'' (17.6 million) easily won the 8 p.m. hour over Fox's ''Prison Break,'' which drew a season-high of 9.9 million viewers. Despite ranking third for the night among adults 18 to 49, CBS managed to finish first in total viewers. Its sitcom ''Two and a Half Men'' outdrew ''Heroes'' and ''24'' in its half-hour at 9 (16.1 million), while ''CSI: Miami'' (18.7 million) dominated the 10 p.m. hour. ABC was fourth over all.</p>
