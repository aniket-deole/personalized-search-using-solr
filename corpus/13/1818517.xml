        <p>The second of two men convicted in the killing of a retired reporter for The New York Times was sentenced to 65 years in prison. The man, Percey Jordan Jr., 43, was convicted of first-degree murder in October. He faced a maximum of life without the possibility of parole for the attack on the reporter, David E. Rosenbaum, last January. Mr. Jordan's cousin Michael C. Hamlin, who was sentenced to 26 years for his role in the death, testified that Mr. Jordan had struck the former reporter over the head with a pipe while he took his wallet. Last week, Mr. Hamlin was sentenced after pleading guilty late last year to second-degree murder.</p>
