        <p>Yury A. Golubev, a founder of Yukos Oil, the former energy giant once led by Mikhail B. Khordokovsky, died sometime last weekend in London. He was 64.</p>
        <p>A Yukos representative confirmed that a visitor to Mr. Golubev's London apartment discovered his body on Monday. A post-mortem confirmed that ''death was by natural causes,'' a statement by the London Metropolitan Police said, adding, ''This death is not treated as suspicious.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Golubev is credited with helping to create Yukos, which was Russia's most prominent and successful company until the Russian government began to systematically dismantle it beginning in 2003.</p>
        <p>Having worked abroad as a senior Soviet trade official in Canada and other countries, he was one of the few Russian businessmen after the collapse of the Soviet Union with knowledge of Western market practices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golubev was one of the architects behind Yukos's effort, starting in the late 1990s, to become a transparent Western-style corporation.</p>
        <p>He was never implicated in the Russian government's legal and prosecutorial assault on the company, which faced crippling back-tax bills that ultimately led to its bankruptcy in 2006. In 2005 Mr. Khodorkovsky, Yukos's chairman and a close partner of Mr. Golubev, was tried and convicted on charges of fraud and tax evasion that critics have denounced as politically motivated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golubev is survived by his wife and two daughters.</p>
