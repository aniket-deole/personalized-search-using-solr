        <p>The New York Fire Department, under threat of a lawsuit from the city's largest fire union, has sent a memo to city firehouses stating that firefighters may post American flags and Mass cards memorializing fallen colleagues on their lockers.</p>
        <p>The memo, which department officials called a ''supplement to the department orders,'' effectively changes a city policy that prohibited anything but firefighters' names and locker numbers on the outside of locker doors. It also answered a demand by the 9,000-member Uniformed Firefighters Association that exceptions to the rule be put in writing.</p>

        <p>The New York Fire Department, under threat of a lawsuit from the city's largest fire union, has sent a memo to city firehouses stating that firefighters may post American flags and Mass cards memorializing fallen colleagues on their lockers.</p>
        <p>The memo, which department officials called a ''supplement to the department orders,'' effectively changes a city policy that prohibited anything but firefighters' names and locker numbers on the outside of locker doors. It also answered a demand by the 9,000-member Uniformed Firefighters Association that exceptions to the rule be put in writing.</p>
        <p>Department officials, who insist the union's complaints are much to do about nothing, have said that any other exceptions, like family photographs, will be decided case by case. But legal experts say that position could lead to arbitrary decisions on what is acceptable.</p>
        <p>Ronald L. Kuby, a civil rights lawyer and radio talk show host hired by the union, said the union still planned to sue if the policy was not more fully altered by the end of the month.</p>
        <p>''To say that firefighters may express one form of speech and not another is always a problem,'' Mr. Kuby said. ''Instead of a blanket ban on all speech and allowing a few exceptions, the department must create a policy that generally permits speech but targets those few areas that the department has a right to ban,'' like racist or pornographic material.</p>
        <p>The department put Regulation 19.2.2 in place 18 months ago after a string of complaints involving racist and sexist material and behavior in firehouses, department officials said.</p>
