        <p>Original episodes and reruns of ''The Sopranos'' have been running on HBO since 1999 and are on DVD. But that didn't stop 4.3 million viewers from watching the basic-cable premiere of the series's first episode on Wednesday night on A&amp;E, according to Nielsen estimates released by the channel. A&amp;E, which is planning to run two episodes of the series each Wednesday night (edited for language, violence and nudity), said its debut showing was well above its prime-time average last year (by more than 200 percent) and good enough to beat the ratings of any other advertiser-supported cable channel that night.</p>
