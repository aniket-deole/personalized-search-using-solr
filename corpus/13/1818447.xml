        <p>Correction:  January 15, 2007, Monday  A list of holiday closings published Saturday and yesterday incorrectly stated the rules for New York City parking meters and the mail service in Connecticut today, Martin Luther King's Birthday. The parking meter regulations remain in effect; they are not suspended. Express Mail will be collected in Connecticut, but there will be no collection of other mail from street mailboxes.</p>
