        <p>MURPHY--Catherine Farrell of New York, NY, passed gentle into that good night on Tuesday, January 9, 2007, in Boca Raton, FL, with her beloved husband, Bill, at her side. She was 77. She was born on March 30, 1929, in New York City. She attended St. Jean Baptiste School on East 75th Street, after which she attended the College of Notre Dame. Post-acadme, she began a 40 year career in advertising. In 1960, she worked on John F. Kennedy's campaign for the Presidency. This began her concentration on political advertising. After a break in the 1960s and early 1970s to raise her two children, Anthony and Susan, she joined Ruth Jones in managing the advertising campaign for Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. Her practice flourished in the 1980s as she managed the advertising media campaigns for President Reagan in 1984 and President Bush in 1988, as well as many prominent Republican Congressional, Senatorial and Gubernatorial candidates. She is survived by her husband, William deBar Murphy, her daughter and son-in-law, Susan Murphy Ferrand and Hugh Ferrand, and her daughter-in-law and son, Sharon Levine Murphy and Anthony Le Bert deBar Murphy; five grandchildren, Hannah, Matilda, Oliver, Samuel and Aidan; two sisters, Eileen French and Jean Roth, and two brothers, Francis Farrell and Martin Farrell; and scores of beloved nieces, nephews and friends. A memorial service will be held in New York on February 11, 2007. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to The Smile Train, 245 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016. www.smiletrain.org.</p>
