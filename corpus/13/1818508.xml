        <p>A man walking along a westbound lane of the Grand Central Parkway near La Guardia Airport last night was hit by two cars and killed, the police said.</p>
        <p>Just before 8 p.m., the pedestrian, a 55-year-old Hispanic man whose identity was not released by the police, was struck by a green Dodge Neon driven by a 30-year-old man, then by a white Honda driven by a 31-year-old woman, the police said.</p>
        <p>The first driver remained at the scene until the police arrived, they said, but the second, unaware that she had hit a person, drove on. When she reached the tollbooths at the Triborough Bridge, she told a police officer that she had struck something, and they directed her to return.</p>
        <p>No charges were filed against either driver. The police said they did not know why the victim had been walking on such a busy highway at night.</p>
