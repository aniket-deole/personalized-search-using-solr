        <p>Street protests continued in the city of Cochabamba as President Evo Morales ordered the army and the police to guard the airport, bridges and public buildings. Mr. Morales asked his supporters to refrain from ''vengeance'' after they clashed with supporters of Cochabamba State's governor, Manfred Reyes Villa. Two people were killed and dozens wounded in clashes this week between groups armed with machetes, bats and rocks, and protesters set fire to the governor's colonial-era palace. The battles erupted after Mr. Reyes Villa joined governors from eastern provinces in pushing for greater political autonomy from the central government.</p>
