        <p>Re ''Do You Believe in Magic?'' (Jan. 23): Benedict Carey opined that superstitious habits ''have little to do with religious faith, which is much more complex,'' and that those whose magical thoughts blossom into delusion are a fundamentally different group.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Carey also quoted a psychologist who noted that ''the point at which the culture withdraws support for belief in Santa and the Tooth Fairy is about the same time it introduces children to prayer.''</p>
        <p>Who among us does not feel that televangelists who tell us God will send a terrorist attack this year, or extremists who round up innocents and torture them, are ''fundamentally different'' from us?</p>
        <p>Superstition, religion, self-defeating delusion and religious extremism are all part and parcel of the same problem: an irrational refusal to accept the world as it really is.</p>
        <p>Erik Honda  San Francisco</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Of the six examples of magical thinking listed with the article's illustration, more investigation needs be done on ''I visualize my immune system destroying the bacteria. It goes away faster.''</p>
        <p>This kind of thinking is second cousin to the placebo effect, which, as I understand it, works this way: ''This pill that I am taking is genuine and my body will respond to it as expected -- in curing my condition.''</p>
        <p>The patient doesn't know that the pill was sugar, but because of the patient's belief, the cure resulted. It may not be magic, but it sure fits the article's description of magic.</p>
        <p>Martin Newman  Los Angeles</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article about magical thinking explains that a lot of otherwise rational people cling to good-luck rituals, particularly at times of stress. I have one that absolutely works.</p>
        <p>When boarding an aircraft, for good luck I touch the outer skin of the plane. It's a skin-to-skin bonding ritual. It actually works; I have never been killed in an airplane crash.</p>
