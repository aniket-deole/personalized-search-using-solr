        <p>BRAYER--Rabbi Menachem M., Ph.D. The Yeshiva University family is deeply grieved by the passing, in Israel, of our distinguished professor emeritus of the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration, who had taught hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of Jewish Education, Bible, Psychology, Hasidism, and other Jewish Studies subjects, and authored many books in Hebrew and in English. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, YU, in recognition of his outstanding leadership and academic achievements for half a century, as well as for rescuing hundreds of Jews in Romania during the Holocaust. A practicing psychologist and psychotherapist, he was revered by all who knew him. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his beloved wife, Rebbitzen Mimi Brayer, his children, Yigal Brayer, Dr. Nancy (and Charles) Block, and the Boyaner Rebbe, Rabbi Nochum Dov (and Rebbitzen Shoshanah) Brayer, to his brother Rabbi Mayer Brayer, his grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees</p>
