        <p>A Jersey City police officer who had been sought on a manslaughter charge in a drunken driving case surrendered to prosecutors yesterday, the authorities said. The officer, Kevin Freibott, 38, of Red Bank, was charged with drunken driving and assault by automobile after critically injuring a 2-year-old boy and his mother on Jan. 23, the police said. Prosecutors upgraded the charges to manslaughter after the boy died on Saturday night, but Officer Freibott could not be found, they said. John A. Young Jr., Officer Freibott's lawyer, said the officer moved his family on Sunday morning to another location after receiving ''disturbing calls'' at his home. ''He was never a fugitive,'' Mr. Young said. ''He wasn't running. His family is here. His children are here. He wasn't going anywhere.''</p>
