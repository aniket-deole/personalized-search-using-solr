        <p>New York City's transportation commissioner, Iris Weinshall, is leaving her post to become a vice chancellor of the City University of New York, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weinshall, who is married to Senator Charles E. Schumer, is the rare commissioner to straddle mayoral administrations. In her new job, she will oversee the planning, building, maintenance and operation of physical structures as vice chancellor for facilities planning, construction and management, said Chancellor Matthew Goldstein.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein recommended Ms. Weinshall's appointment, which was approved by the City University board last night, and she will report to him. But she will also be supervised by the university's executive vice chancellor and chief operating officer, Allan H. Dobrin, who was the city's technology commissioner under former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weinshall, who lives in Brooklyn, was appointed to her current post by Mr. Giuliani in 2000 after holding senior positions in the Department of Citywide Administrative Services and the Department of Environmental Protection. An honors graduate of Brooklyn College, which is part of the City University system, Ms. Weinshall, 53, has a master's degree in public administration from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University.</p>
