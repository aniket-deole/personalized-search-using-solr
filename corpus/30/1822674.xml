        <p>At 8:45 a.m. yesterday, Mets shortstop José Reyes sat shivering on a sidewalk in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>Next to him was Twins starting pitcher Johan Santana, who was grilling a hamburger. It was about 20 degrees outside, and the wind chill made it seem like the low teens.</p>
        <p>So what were Reyes and Santana doing there?</p>
        <p>Along with five other players -- Minnesota's Justin Morneau, Detroit's Justin Verlander, Boston's Jonathan Papelbon, St. Louis's David Eckstein and the Yankees' Robinson Canó -- they were filming a commercial for new baseball caps under the direction of Spike Lee.</p>
        <p>The hats, manufactured by New Era, are designed to absorb sweat more efficiently, and they have a new black underside to the bill intended to reduce glare. Over and over, from 7 a.m. till noon, the players filmed the ad with 10-minute breaks from the cold.</p>
        <p>''I got an idea about how to stay warm,'' said Morneau, the 2006 American League most valuable player, as he shuffled between the street and a dressing room at the back of the store. ''I could find all the White Sox hats and light them on fire.''</p>
