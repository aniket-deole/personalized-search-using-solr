      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An uproar over a cabinet minister who called women ''baby-making devices'' sent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe scrambling to control damage to his already falling popularity. In Parliament, Mr. Abe said the remark by his health minister, Hakuo Yanagisawa, left, was ''inappropriate'' and said he had reprimanded him. Mr. Yanagisawa also apologized for the remark, made Saturday at a political rally while calling on women to reverse Japan's declining birthrate by bearing more children. The remark was the second recent slip of the tongue by a member of Mr. Abe's administration. Last week, the defense minister, Fumio Kyuma, said President Bush ''made a mistake'' in attacking Iraq, contradicting Tokyo's official pro-Washington stance. An opinion poll released yesterday by the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun showed Mr. Abe's approval has fallen to 40 percent, down from almost 70 percent when he took office in September.</p>
