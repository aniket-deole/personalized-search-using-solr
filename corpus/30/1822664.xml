        <p>Correction of Jan 19 obituary of actor Ron Carey</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An obituary on Jan. 19 about Ron Carey, a comic actor, referred incorrectly to the character he played on the situation comedy ''Barney Miller.'' He was a uniformed policeman, not a ''plainclothes cop.'' The obituary also included an outdated title for a television show that Mr. Carey appeared on in 1969 and 1970. By that time, it was known as ''The Ed Sullivan Show,'' not ''Toast of the Town.''</p>
