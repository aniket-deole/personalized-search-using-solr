        <p>The body of an infant girl was discovered yesterday afternoon at the bottom of a trash chute in a Bronx apartment building, the police said.</p>
        <p>The baby, described by investigators as Hispanic and less than 4 months old, was declared dead at the scene. It was unclear when or how she had died.</p>
        <p>Last night, investigators searched the 19-story apartment building, at 225 Willis Avenue in Mott Haven, with a German shepherd to determined where the baby may have been in the complex.</p>
        <p>The baby was found shortly before 4 p.m., when a maintenance worker who was in the trash compactor room heard a loud thud, an investigator said. It did not sound like trash falling, so he looked inside the bin.</p>
        <p>One resident, Geraldine Pinckney, 46, who had heard the maintenance man describe how he had discovered the baby, said: ''He went to see what was in there, and when he opened it, he thought it was a doll baby until he saw the blue lips, and then he knew.''</p>
        <p>Maintenance workers said that the baby's body was intact and that she appeared to have been dead before being thrown down the chute. Investigators said she was wearing a pink hooded coat and a white jumper.</p>
        <p>Other residents said they did not know of any babies recently born to tenants in the building.</p>
        <p>''I know everyone in this building after 14 years,'' said Doris Soto, 43. ''I can't believe this happened. I'm trying to remember who I know and who I've seen that has small babies.''</p>
        <p>Tenants, who were kept waiting outside the building during the investigation last night, were shaken by the discovery. Isabelle Johnson, 63, president of the tenants association, said: ''This is chaotic. It doesn't make any sense. There are so many outs that you have. You can run away. You can bang on someone's door. Anything.''</p>
