''Cold Case,'' the night's most-watched program, garnered 15.1 million viewers at 8 p.m. It was preceded by ''60 Minutes'' at 7 (14.3 million), and followed by the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie ''The Valley of Light,'' with Chris Klein, which attracted 14.7 million viewers from 9 to 11. ABC won the night among adults 18 to 49 and finished second in total viewers. NBC ranked third, as the first live edition of ''Grease: You're the One That I Want'' posted the series's lowest rating yet, averaging 7.3 million viewers from 7 to 9 p.m. Following it ''The Apprentice'' improved over its week-ago performance, drawing 8.4 million viewers and finishing No. 2 in the 9 p.m. hour among adults 18 to 49.</p>
