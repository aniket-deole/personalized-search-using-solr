        <p>Feeling pretty good about yourself, urbanites? Climb off that high horse and mosey over to ''The Fever,'' a monologue written, staged and performed by Wallace Shawn, the playwright and ''Princess Bride'' villain. It ''argues that virtually every transaction undertaken by an American city-dweller rests on a sturdy foundation of moral turpitude,'' says Charles Isherwood (and yes, that includes going to the theater). Though he may take too long to do it, ''Mr. Shawn exposes the contradictions and compromises of the urban liberal mind with a mercilessness that is sly and at times hilarious.'' Meanwhile, his brother, Allen, undertakes an investigation into his own mind in ''Wish I Could Be There,'' ''a brave, eccentric and utterly compelling book'' about his many, many phobias.Michiko Kakutani says it's ''as revelatory and candid as anything ever written by Joan Didion, and as humane and scientifically fascinating as any one of Oliver Sacks's case studies.'' Giddyap.</p>
        <p>''The Fever,'' 8 p.m. tonight, the New Group at the Acorn Theater, Theater Row , 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200; through March 3; $51.25. ''Wish I Could Be There: Notes From a Phobic Life,'' $24.95.</p>
