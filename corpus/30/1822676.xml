        <p>The Colts' four chartered buses pulled up to the Fort Lauderdale hotel that will serve as their headquarters a few minutes late Monday, although some would argue they were running much later than that considering their opponents, the Bears, traveled to South Florida on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Tony Dungy decided to give his players an extra day to spend with their families in Indianapolis before joining the party well under way.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to do it that way,'' Dungy said. ''We thought it was best for us to win.''</p>
        <p>Dungy reasoned that the Colts needed rest more than any Super Bowl-related recreation. They had not enjoyed a weekend off since their open date Oct. 15. ''We had a great week of practice Wednesday, Thursday and Friday,'' Dungy said. ''We had a great workout this morning.''</p>
        <p>Noting that the players will have the rest of Tuesday to themselves after meeting with the news media in the morning, tight end Dallas Clark said: ''We normally have Tuesdays off, and after meeting with the media, we'll get the rest of the day to explore Miami. I think it's really going to help the players not to throw them off their regular week of work.''</p>
        <p>Before the Colts left, Dungy tried to drive home the point that this was a business trip. ''We've got to look at this as our time to do it now,'' he said, ''and I think we'll be focused in on it.''</p>
