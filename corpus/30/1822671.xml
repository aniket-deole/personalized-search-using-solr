        <p>A 17-year-old who was shot on Sunday when he tried to grab an off-duty police officer's pistol during a struggle in Jackson Heights was charged yesterday with attempted third-degree robbery, the police said. The teenager, Edwin Guaman, remained at Elmhurst Hospital Center last evening, the police said. The officer, Lt. Jose Jacome, a 16-year veteran assigned to the 110th Precinct, came upon Mr. Guaman and another man early Sunday beating a third person who was yelling that he was being robbed, the police said. Lieutenant Jacome identified himself as a police officer and tried to stop the robbery, the police said. It remained unclear yesterday whether the shot was accidental and who fired it, the police said.</p>
