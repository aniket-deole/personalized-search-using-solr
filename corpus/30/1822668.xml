        <p>Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe canceled an agreement yesterday under which East Coast Golf was to pay the city a minimum of $9.6 million in fees over 20 years to renovate and operate a golf course in Marine Park. The cancellation, effective in a month, came after William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, raised concerns about the company's president, Domenick Logozzo, and his financial relationship with Craig Marino, whom federal prosecutors have described as a soldier in the Colombo crime family. Mr. Marino was one of 10 people indicted in March on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges. According to prosecutors, Mr. Logozzo lent Mr. Marino and his father money and a car but has not been implicated in any criminal activity in the indictment. Calls to Mr. Logozzo's place of business were not returned yesterday.</p>
