        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Busywork for Nuclear Scientists'' (editorial, Jan. 15):</p>
        <p>Nuclear deterrence undergirds America's security and that of our allies.</p>
        <p>The administration is committed to the smallest nuclear stockpile consistent with our security; to safe, secure and reliable weapons; and to the current nuclear testing moratorium. That's why it seeks to develop the Reliable Replacement Warhead.</p>
        <p>You do not acknowledge the national security potential this warhead holds, and you make light of its increased safety and security features. In a terrorist age, nuclear safety and security are crucial.</p>
        <p>There is no ''busywork.'' Developing the warhead will increase security while maintaining our nuclear scientists' design skills.</p>
        <p>This warhead will not hurt American credibility overseas. It does not expand capabilities, but replaces existing weapons with ones of greater reliability. With greater confidence in our weapons' reliability, we could significantly reduce the numbers of spare warheads.</p>
        <p>I disagree that President Bush has not focused on nuclear arms reduction. Under plans he approved, by 2012 the stockpile will be at the lowest levels since the Eisenhower administration.</p>
        <p>The Reliable Replacement Warhead will give the United States up-to-date security and safety while making it easier to maintain the stockpile. It deserves support, not condemnation.</p>
        <p>Linton F. Brooks  Washington, Jan. 25, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is the former administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration.</p>
