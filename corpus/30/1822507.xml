        <p>A new study suggests that having many siblings may increase the risk for certain stomach cancers and that younger siblings may be more at risk than older ones.</p>
        <p>Researchers gathered blood samples from 7,429 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii from 1967 to 1975 to determine whether they were infected with Helicobacter pylori, a childhood infection known to increase the risk for stomach cancer much later in life. They followed the men for 28 years, during which 261 developed gastric cancer.</p>
        <p>From that group, the researchers selected the cases of those infected with H. pylori -- 239, or 92 percent -- and compared them with a group of cancer-free, but also infected, controls. The team then looked at family size and birth order in both groups.</p>
        <p>Among the cases with the most the virulent strain of H. pylori, called cagA, those from families with seven or more children were more than twice as likely to develop cancer as those from families with one to three children, and younger children had a higher risk than older ones.</p>
        <p>The study appears in the January issue of PloS Medicine.</p>
        <p>''It's remarkable that something that's happening in the early years of life affects the risk of a cancer happening seven decades later,'' said Dr. Martin J. Blaser, the lead author and a professor of medicine at New York University. ''It's my hypothesis that this may be a model system for other cancers.''</p>
        <p>The authors acknowledge that some factor other than family size or birth order may be the cause of the findings. But they suggest that the germ is transmitted among siblings, and that the immature immune systems of younger children may make them more susceptible.</p>
