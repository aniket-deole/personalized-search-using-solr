        <p>Soundtrack to film Dreamgirls is No 1 on Billboard chart for second week in row (S)</p>

        <p>Music sales continued to slide last week, with another dubious victory for the soundtrack to ''Dreamgirls'' (Sony): it is on the top of the Billboard chart for the second time in a row, but it beat its own record for the lowest sales for a No. 1 album since SoundScan began tracking music purchases 16 years ago. In the week that ended Sunday, the soundtrack to ''Dreamgirls,'' which recently won a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy film, moved 60,000 copies, 6,000 fewer than it did the week before. Akon's ''Konvicted'' (Universal) remains at No. 2 with 55,000 sales; Justin Timberlake's ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' (Jive) climbed one spot to No. 3 with 51,000; and the ''American Idol'' alumnus Chris Daughtry is No. 4 with 50,000 sales of ''Daughtry'' (RCA). Only two new albums are among the Top 100 sellers this week: the soundtrack to the Disney Channel movie ''Jump In!'' (Disney), at No. 5, and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma's ''Appassionato'' (Sony Classical), which reached No. 79, Mr. Ma's highest-ever position on the Billboard 200 chart.</p>
