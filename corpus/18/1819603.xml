        <p>Granddaughter, Sprouting</p>
        <p>Q. I am a former gardener, now in a New York apartment. My 4-year-old granddaughter lives in Washington, in a house with a small north-facing front yard. She has told me she'd like to grow flowers, a wish I'm eager to grant. I visit monthly, and her parents will water, but that is all the help she will get. What can we plant? Can we start anything in February?</p>
        <p>A. Given the age of the principal gardener and her limited staff, it would be best to stick with containers, which are easier to prepare and tend than open ground.</p>

        <p>Granddaughter, Sprouting</p>
        <p>Q. I am a former gardener, now in a New York apartment. My 4-year-old granddaughter lives in Washington, in a house with a small north-facing front yard. She has told me she'd like to grow flowers, a wish I'm eager to grant. I visit monthly, and her parents will water, but that is all the help she will get. What can we plant? Can we start anything in February?</p>
        <p>A. Given the age of the principal gardener and her limited staff, it would be best to stick with containers, which are easier to prepare and tend than open ground.</p>
        <p>Half-barrels are a good size and widely available, but hundreds of more stylish options are offered by Web-based specialists like SimplyPlanters.com, (800) 971-4269, and the more modernistic PlantContainers.com, (866) 342-3330.</p>
        <p>Whatever you choose should be at least 14 inches square or 16 in diameter and a foot deep, and should have holes in the bottom for drainage.</p>
        <p>After frost danger is past, fill the containers with a soilless planting medium like Pro-mix. Add a time-release fertilizer like Osmocote. Plant reliable low-light performers: tuberous begonias, impatiens and fuchsias. Full-service garden centers should have everything you need.</p>
        <p>For starry, edible blue flowers over wide fuzzy leaves, sprinkle in a few borage seeds (from Nichols Garden Nursery, 800-422-3985 or nicholsgardennursery.com, or Kitchen Garden Seeds, 860-567-6086 or kitchengardenseeds.com). Borage tends to be rangy in low light, an advantage when it is combined with short, compact plants like impatiens. It is also large: plan to thin the plants on one of your visits.</p>
        <p>If any containers can be placed in sun, consider nasturtiums and morning glories. They start with large, easy-to-handle seeds, bloom all summer and thrive on neglect. (Omit fertilizer with these two, or you'll get nothing but leaves.)</p>
        <p>In February or anytime, sprouts are an ideal way to start gardening. In less than a week, with no soil, no sun and no special equipment, anyone can grow delicious vegetables while having a ringside seat at one of nature's miracles: the transformation of seed to plant.</p>
        <p>Lentils are my favorite; natural food stores sell dozens of others. And if you missed the '60s or otherwise never learned, a good sprouting guide is at extension.oregonstate.edu/catalog/html/ec/ec1358.</p>
