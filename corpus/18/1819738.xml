        <p>Perhaps the most famous construction crew in the city's history is down a man.</p>
        <p>A figure of an ironworker has been stolen from a sculpture that stood at ground zero for five months and replicates a famous photograph of workers eating lunch on a steel beam high above the city, the police said.</p>
        <p>The sculpture is a life-size depiction of the unattributed 1932 photograph, which shows a group of 11 ironworkers above the Rockefeller Center construction site.</p>
        <p>The rightmost figure in the sculpture disappeared sometime between Sunday night and yesterday afternoon from outside the sculptor's studio on 47th Avenue in Long Island City, Queens, the sculptor said.</p>
        <p>The sculptor, Sergio Furnari, 37, said he discovered it was missing yesterday when he went out to a truck that carries the sculpture, intending to drive it around Manhattan. He said the thieves had to have climbed up 12 feet just to get to the 100-pound figure, which was welded to a beam.</p>
        <p>''It was something premeditated,'' he said. ''It wasn't a bunch of kids just passing by.'' Last night investigators were taking fingerprints at the scene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Furnari worked for a year on the artwork, finishing a few weeks after Sept. 11, 2001. It resonated with the workers clearing ground zero, and was given a space near the viewing platform in May 2002, where it remained for five months before going on a coast-to-coast tour.</p>
        <p>''The twin towers were made by the ironworkers, and it was the ironworkers that had to remove the whole steel out of ground zero,'' Mr. Furnari said.</p>
        <p>''Those statues meant a lot after 9/11 for all New Yorkers,'' he said. ''It's American history. Those are the guys who built America. Part of me feels like, if they took that, they took a piece of New York City and American history.''</p>
