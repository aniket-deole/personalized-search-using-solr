        <p>INSPIRED by the quirky tables made of roots or tree trunks that were popular in Adirondack camps in the early 20th century, many contemporary designers are creating new pieces, often from reclaimed wood. The wood -- found fallen in the forest or floating in streams -- may be chiseled or sanded into squares or egg shapes. These eccentric tables mix well with modern furniture and are an easy way to warm up spare interiors.</p>
        <p>For those who prefer the older pieces, there are plenty of opportunities to find vintage tables in Manhattan this week. This winter's week of Americana antiques shows begins today.</p>
