        <p>The Department of Homeland Security is setting up a new, simplified way for travelers to file an appeal if their journey is disrupted by security queries. The new system will allow travelers who have been denied or delayed boarding an airplane or entering the United States, or have been subjected to more intense searches or questioning by a department official to question why they were the target of such scrutiny. The new system, called the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program, will allow the person to file and track the status of the claim online and is scheduled to start late next month.</p>
