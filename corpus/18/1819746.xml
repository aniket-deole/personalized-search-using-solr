        <p>Martin J. O'Malley was sworn in as governor in a ceremony in Annapolis that included a surprise guest, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, a Maryland native. Mr. O'Malley, a Democrat, was mayor of Baltimore for nearly two terms. He pledged to make good on a campaign promise to finance school construction, announcing this week plans to direct $400 million in state money toward that goal in his first year as governor. Other priorities include making health care more affordable and accessible, reducing energy costs and restoring of Chesapeake Bay. He replaced a Republican, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.</p>
