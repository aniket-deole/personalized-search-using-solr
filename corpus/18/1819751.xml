        <p>A 19-year-old from Auburndale has admitted attacking two Asian men in Douglaston last summer and beating another man with a hammer in a separate attack last May, prosecutors said yesterday. The teenager, Kevin M. Brown, pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court to assault as a hate crime for the attack on the Asian men and assault for the other attack, and is scheduled to be sentenced to three and a half years in prison, said the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. Prosecutors said that Kevin Brown, who worked as a parking valet, took part in an Aug. 12 attack on John Lu and Reynold Liang, both 19, in which he kicked and punched both men and beat Mr. Liang with a car steering wheel lock. On May 7, prosecutors said, he struck Panagotis Karatzas, 30, on the head with a hammer during a traffic dispute.</p>
