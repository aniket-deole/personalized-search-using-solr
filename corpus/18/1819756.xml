        <p>The body of a missing New York college student was found in a lake here yesterday, two days after he disappeared, the Connecticut state police said. The student, Joseph Zahornacky, 22, who lived in Shelton, Conn., and was a student at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., was reported missing on Monday night, just hours after he told relatives that he was on his way back to school from La Guardia Airport, the police said. Mr. Zahornacky had just returned from a visit to his girlfriend in California. On Tuesday night, the authorities said, the police found his 2000 Jeep Cherokee in Lake Lillinonah, the same body of water where they discovered his body about 11 a.m. yesterday. Lt. J. Paul Vance of the state police said that detectives were awaiting the results of an autopsy. Mr. Zahornacky's brother Michael said the police told him that they did not suspect foul play. He described his brother as an avid guitarist and surfer, and said he was one of four siblings.</p>
