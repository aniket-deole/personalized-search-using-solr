        <p>Editorial scores Bush administration for removing several United States attorneys from their jobs; cites removal of US Atty Carol Lam, prosecutor who was investigating Rep Jerry Lewis</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In its secretive purge of key United States attorneys, the Bush administration is needlessly giving comfort to any number of individuals now under federal investigation. Most prominently, there is Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican whose dealings as appropriations chairman have been under scrutiny in the continuing investigation of lawmakers delivering quid pro quo favors for contractors and lobbyists.</p>
        <p>U.S. Attorney Carol Lam of San Diego is one of a number of prosecutors (there's no official tally) being forced from office without the courtesy of an explanation. A career professional, Ms. Lam ran a first-rate investigation of Randy Cunningham, the former Republican congressman from California, who admitted taking more than $2.4 million in bribes.</p>

        <p>In its secretive purge of key United States attorneys, the Bush administration is needlessly giving comfort to any number of individuals now under federal investigation. Most prominently, there is Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican whose dealings as appropriations chairman have been under scrutiny in the continuing investigation of lawmakers delivering quid pro quo favors for contractors and lobbyists.</p>
        <p>U.S. Attorney Carol Lam of San Diego is one of a number of prosecutors (there's no official tally) being forced from office without the courtesy of an explanation. A career professional, Ms. Lam ran a first-rate investigation of Randy Cunningham, the former Republican congressman from California, who admitted taking more than $2.4 million in bribes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lam then turned her attention to Mr. Lewis as she plumbed Congress's weakness for ''earmarks'' -- legislation that lawmakers customize on behalf of deep-pocketed campaign contributors. The focus moved to Mr. Lewis -- who has denied any wrongdoing -- after the disclosure that one of his staff aides became a lobbyist and arranged windfall contracts worth hundreds of millions.</p>
        <p>Stymied by the previous Republican Congress, Ms. Lam was negotiating with the new Democratic leadership to obtain extensive earmarks documentation for her investigation when the administration forced her resignation.</p>
        <p>Legal professionals are defending Ms. Lam, with the F.B.I. chief in San Diego asking: ''What do you expect her to do? Let corruption exist?'' It's especially alarming that the White House can use a loophole in the Patriot Act to name a successor who will not have to face questions or confirmation by the Senate. The administration owes the nation a full explanation of a move that reeks of politics.</p>
