        <p>An East Orange man already in custody on charges of setting his uncle on fire was charged with murder on Tuesday in the fatal shooting of a clothing store owner on Jan. 3, the police said yesterday. The man, Lamar A. Tidwell, 24, is charged with walking into the Clothing Wholesale and Retail Urban Warestore on Main Street and shooting the owner, Allen Cuff, 34. The men had argued a week earlier, said Judy Gagliano, an assistant Essex County prosecutor. Mr. Tidwell also faces weapons charges in that case. On Saturday he was charged with attempted murder; the authorities said he set fire to his uncle, Richard Burns, 54, in Mr. Burns's apartment in East Orange after an argument. Mr. Burns suffered injuries over 22 percent of his body and was in critical condition yesterday at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston. Mr. Tidwell is being held in $1 million bail at the Essex County jail.</p>
