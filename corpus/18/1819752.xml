        <p>A Ridgewood man has been charged with murder and assault in the shooting of two men outside a nightclub in Woodside three months ago, prosecutors said yesterday. The man, Victor Gavalo, 24, of Stephens Street, was awaiting arraignment on the charges last evening in Queens Criminal Court. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said that Mr. Gavalo was charged with shooting the men on Oct. 1 as they sat in a car outside Club Phenomenon, which was shuttered last month under the public nuisance abatement law. The dead man was Ernesto Salgado, 22, of Sunnyside; the wounded man's identity was not released.</p>
