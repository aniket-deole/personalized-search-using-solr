        <p>WOHL--Ivy. How very sad we are by the untimely death of our precious friend Ivy. We loved her and enjoyed so many memorable times together. To her beloved husband, our Rabbi Amiel Wohl, to her children, Dr. John Feder and his wife Dr. Annette Cohen, Daniel Feder, Beatrice Niv, and husband Ohad, her sister Joan and brotherin-law Paul Siskind, and all her grandchildren, we extend our love and tears. We will always remember our dear Ivy. Rita and Philip Rosen and Family.</p>

Ivy Wohl's work included television, the psychiatry department of New York Medical College, and the National Chapter of the March of Dimes.
