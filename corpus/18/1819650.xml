        <p>The Afghan Intelligence Service announced Wednesday that it had detained a Taliban spokesman, who said in a videotape released with the announcement that Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, was hiding in Pakistan.</p>
        <p>NATO also said Wednesday that NATO-led troops and the Afghan National Security forces had detained a Taliban commander, whom it did not identify, in a raid on Tuesday in Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>The Afghan Intelligence Service said that it had detained the Taliban spokesman with two of his associates on Monday as they entered Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan from Pakistan.</p>
        <p>The videotape showed a young Afghan who introduced himself as Abdul Haq and said he had been a spokesman for the Taliban for the past 14 months under the fictitious name of Dr. Muhammad Hanif. He said that Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, was in Quetta, Pakistan, with the support of Pakistan's security service.</p>
        <p>The Afghan government and President Hamid Karzai have repeatedly accused Pakistan of sheltering Taliban leaders and fighters. Pakistan denies it. It was not known whether the statement on the tape about Mullah Omar, who has not been seen since 2001, was made under duress.</p>
        <p>Also on Wednesday, a remotely controlled mine struck an Afghan National Army vehicle in Khost Province in the east, killing three soldiers and wounding four others, said Gen. Zahir Azimi, a Defense Ministry spokesman.</p>
        <p>The blast occurred while Mr. Karzai was in Khost to inaugurate an national army installation, but he was miles from the site of the attack.</p>
