        <p>CINCOTTA--Joseph J., on January 13, 2007. Died peacefully in his sleep after a long illness, bravely borne, at age 83. He passed away at home surrounded by love and a devoted circle of friends. Beloved husband of the late Marion (nee Ferguson). Cherished father of Constance. Loving brother of the late Grace Baudhuin, Rose Deatherage and Mickey. Survived by nieces, nephews and extended family. He was a good friend and benefactor to many. Commonly known as ''Joe Glenwood,'' his life was driven by a passion for the business he created and loved, ''Glenwood Mason Supply Company''. A tireless businessman, he has left his legacy across the five boroughs where every neighborhood is comprised of buildings constructed with materials he proudly manufactured and supplied. This stands as a testament to his wisdom, diligence and forbearance. Joe served his country proudly during World War II, in the Pacific Theater, as a sailor in the US Navy. Funeral Friday, 12:15 pm from the McManus Funeral Home, 4601 Avenue 'N' (corner East 46th St), Brooklyn. Service 1:15 pm at the Green-Wood Cemetery Historic Chapel. Interment to follow. Friends may call at the Funeral Home, Wednesday and Thursday, 2:00 -4:30 and 7:00 -9:00.</p>
