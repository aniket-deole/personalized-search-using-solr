        <p>The state reversed its decision to bar a Massachusetts beer distributor from selling three types of beer because its labels were deemed offensive. The Maine Bureau of Liquor Enforcement said the labels, two that feature bare-breasted women and one that shows Santa Claus from behind and sitting on a barrel, contained ''undignified or improper illustrations.'' The distributor, Shelton Brothers, filed a federal lawsuit against the state, which reversed its decision Dec. 20, said the owner, Will Shelton. He said he had not received a letter alerting him of the reversal until this week because he was in Germany.</p>
