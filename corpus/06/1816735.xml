        <p>The new leader of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be paid $42,000 more than his predecessor, a raise that is justified because he will have a wider role in running the agency and shaping policy, a spokesman for Gov. Eliot Spitzer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Elliot G. Sander, who started work this week as the executive director and chief executive of the authority, will receive a salary of $265,000 and a housing allowance of $60,000, according to Christine Anderson, the press secretary for Governor Spitzer, who chose Mr. Sander to run the agency. Mr. Sander will also receive $15,000 in deferred compensation, in the form of payments into a personal retirement account, bringing his total compensation to $340,000 a year.</p>

        <p>The new leader of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be paid $42,000 more than his predecessor, a raise that is justified because he will have a wider role in running the agency and shaping policy, a spokesman for Gov. Eliot Spitzer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Elliot G. Sander, who started work this week as the executive director and chief executive of the authority, will receive a salary of $265,000 and a housing allowance of $60,000, according to Christine Anderson, the press secretary for Governor Spitzer, who chose Mr. Sander to run the agency. Mr. Sander will also receive $15,000 in deferred compensation, in the form of payments into a personal retirement account, bringing his total compensation to $340,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The previous executive director, Katherine N. Lapp, received a salary of $235,000, a housing allowance of $48,000 and a deferred payment of $15,000, for a total pay of $298,000.</p>
        <p>The words ''chief executive'' have been added to Mr. Sander's title, and his role will include some of the duties previously handled by the authority's chairman, whose unpaid position has had a prominent decision-making function.</p>
        <p>''His duties are expanding and he's taking more on than his predecessor,'' Ms. Anderson said of Mr. Sander and the 14 percent pay raise. Mr. Sander will make more than Governor Spitzer, who is paid $179,000 a year, according to the office of the state comptroller.</p>
        <p>But he will earn less than the executives of some other transit agencies around the country. The new general manager of the Washington, D.C., transit system will make more than $375,000 a year, a spokeswoman said.</p>
