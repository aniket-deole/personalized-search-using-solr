        <p>The authorities investigating the killing of Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former K.G.B. officer who died in London in November of a high dose of the radioactive isotope polonium 210, said they had detected radiation contamination at a restaurant in the Mayfair district of London. The Health Protection Agency said the restaurant, Pescatori, had been closed, decontaminated and reopened for business. The authorities have found traces of radiation in several other restaurants and hotels visited by Mr. Litvinenko and his associates just before he fell ill. This week, a staff member at the Best Western Shaftesbury Hotel in central London reportedly tested positive for low levels of polonium 210, bringing to 12 the number of people said by the authorities to have been contaminated in Britain. The others are nine staff members at two other London hotels and Mr. Litvinenko's widow, Marina.</p>
