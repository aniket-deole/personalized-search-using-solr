        <p>Thomas M. Finneran, former speaker of the State House, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and making false statements in court about his role in drawing a redistricting map. Mr. Finneran, 56, resigned as speaker in 2004 and is now chairman of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. He was indicted in 2005 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice during a case that contended that the new districting map intentionally disenfranchised minority voters and was favorable to incumbents. Mr. Finneran, a Democrat, said he had no involvement in creating the map. Under a plea bargain, however, he said he had reviewed the map with numerous legislators. Mr. Finneran will serve 18 months of probation and pay a $25,000 fine.</p>
