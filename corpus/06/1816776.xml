        <p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper lured a Liberal member of Parliament to his Conservative caucus, improving odds that his minority government will survive attempts by opposition parties to force an election. The lawmaker, Wajid Khan of Toronto, a former pilot in the Pakistani Air Force, said he had defected partly because he had to choose between staying a Liberal and continuing as a special adviser to Mr. Harper on South Asia and the Middle East. The Conservatives control 125 seats in the 308-seat House of Commons, and can now win votes with the support of any one of three opposition parties.</p>
