        <p>A jury convicted a 27-year-old British Muslim, Umran Javed, of soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred after he spoke at a rally outside the Danish Embassy in London last February against the Danish cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad. Sentencing will be in April. Prosecutors said he appeared to lead protesters in chants of ''Bomb, bomb Denmark. Bomb, bomb U.S.A.'' Mr. Javed told the court that they were ''just slogans, sound bites,'' and that he regretted saying them. ''I did not want to see Denmark and the U.S.A. being bombed,'' he said.</p>
