        <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles yesterday allowed Anthony Pellicano, the Hollywood private eye, to represent himself at his forthcoming trial on wiretapping, racketeering and conspiracy charges. Mr. Pellicano, 62, has said he is unable to pay a lawyer. When Judge Dale S. Fischer asked if he had had any legal training or education, Mr. Pellicano said, ''I have some experience.'' Daniel A. Saunders, an assistant United States attorney, recited the charges against him, which carry a maximum sentence of 625 years in prison and a $26.75 million fine. The judge urged Mr. Pellicano to accept appointed counsel, but said she would stop him from representing himself only if his behavior became a problem. ''I will never disrespect the court, nor will I act dishonorably, period,'' Mr. Pellicano said.</p>
