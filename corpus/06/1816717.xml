        <p>After eight months of sometimes difficult negotiations, EarthLink and the city of San Francisco said on Friday that they had reached an agreement to create a citywide wireless broadband network.</p>
        <p>The Internet search giant Google will provide free service on the network at relatively low transmission speeds, while EarthLink and others will charge for faster service. The monthly fee will be $21.95, but 3,200 low-income residents will be charged $12.95.</p>

        <p>After eight months of sometimes difficult negotiations, EarthLink and the city of San Francisco said on Friday that they had reached an agreement to create a citywide wireless broadband network.</p>
        <p>The Internet search giant Google will provide free service on the network at relatively low transmission speeds, while EarthLink and others will charge for faster service. The monthly fee will be $21.95, but 3,200 low-income residents will be charged $12.95.</p>
        <p>''You can't continue to rhetorically talk about the digital divide and not do anything about it,'' Gavin Newsom, the city's mayor, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The network will be built, owned and operated by EarthLink, which last year estimated the initial cost of deployment at about $6 million. EarthLink will also pay certain fees to the city for access to rights of way and city property.</p>
        <p>The project has faced opposition from a variety of critics, including some who argued that the city should own the broadband network and some who raised fears of privacy violations. The new agreement establishes some basic privacy protections and requires EarthLink and Google to fully disclose their privacy policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newsom said that as early as next week he would submit the plan to the County Board of Supervisors, which must give its final approval to the project. The network could begin operating within a year of approval.</p>
        <p>Google already owns and operates a free wireless broadband network in Mountain View, the Bay Area city where it is based.</p>
        <p>Megan Quinn, a Google spokeswoman, said the company did not plan to require users of the free service to look at advertising.</p>
