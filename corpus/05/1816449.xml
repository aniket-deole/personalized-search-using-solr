        <p>France has had more than a casual stake in jazz history. Some of the most influential jazz critics of the 1930s and '40s were French -- notably Hughes Panassie, Charles Delaunay and André Hodeir -- and they established a culture of appreciation that has not abated. (Among the stereotypes recently skewered by Sacha Baron Cohen was the French jazz aficionado; when we first meet his character Jean Girard in ''Talladega Nights,'' he's kicking back to John Coltrane on a jukebox in a country bar.) And over the years France has developed its share of serious musicians. That legacy in particular fuels the French Quarter Festival, an initiative of cultural organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. The festival, also scheduled to run in New Orleans and Washington, gathers a potpourri of French jazz talent; next week's offerings in New York are bountiful. On Monday the pianist Hervé Sellin and the bassist Riccardo del Fra will appear together at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, while the pianist Bojan Z and the guitarist Louis Winsberg will each lead a trio at the Blue Note. On Tuesday the France-Louisiana Friendship Concert will be held at Joe's Pub. On Wednesday and Thursday the violinist Didier Lockwood and the guitarist Sylvain Luc will perform with the drummer Billy Cobham at the Cutting Room. Also on Wednesday a handful of French artists, including the singer Mina Agossi and the percussionist Mino Cinelu, right, will take part in the NYC Winter JazzFest at the Knitting Factory. And at the 34th annual conference of the International Association for Jazz Education, which initiated the festival in collaboration with CulturesFrance, numerous performances will take place, along with some official business: the presentation of an IAJE President Award to the composer Michel Legrand. (The French Quarter Festival runs from Monday through Jan. 21 at various locations. Information: frenchculture.org.)</p>
