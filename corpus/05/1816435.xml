        <p>FRIEDMAN--Jack, 84, of Hewlett and Boca Raton, died January 4, 2008. For 63 years he was a beloved and loving husband of Jacklyn, a loving and devoted father of David, Dianne and Steven, a most affectionate father-in-law to Rebecca and Michael, and a proud grandfather of seven and great-grandfather of two. An avid tennis player, pianist and music lover, a veteran of WWII, a life long fan of the New York Yankees, he was cheerful and accepting and gave generously of himself to others. He had a wonderful sense of humor and was a true gentlemen in the best sense of the word. He will be sorely missed.</p>
