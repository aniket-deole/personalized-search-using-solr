        <p>Misconduct complaints in the New York City schools system climbed 38 percent in 2006 compared with the previous year, the special commissioner for investigation of the city schools said in an annual report. The commissioner, Richard J. Condon, said his office received 2,552 complaints in 2006, compared with 1,849 in 2005. Complaints can include allegations of cheating, abuse of students and theft. The report said 259 cases were substantiated, with 101 referred to prosecutors, compared with 251 substantiated cases and 60 referrals to prosecutors in 2005. Mr. Condon attributed the increase to use of the city's 311 hot line and pressure on workers to report misdeeds.</p>
