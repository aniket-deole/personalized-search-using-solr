        <p>Gov. Eliot Spitzer named four staff members, three of whom have been close advisers and a fourth, Debra Bachrach, who has been a lawyer and lobbyist. Ms. Bachrach was named deputy commissioner of the Office of Health Insurance Programs and also the state's Medicaid director. The move follows his appointment of Lorraine A. Cortés-Vázquez, a former Cablevision lobbyist, as his secretary of state. Among the other appointees was Lloyd Constantine, who served as co-chairman of his transition team. He was named special counsel. Also appointed were two people who served under Mr. Spitzer while he was attorney general: Joe Baker was named assistant deputy secretary for health and human services, and Marlene Turner was named chief of staff.</p>

        <p>Correction:  January 23, 2007, Tuesday  A report in the Metro Briefing column on Jan. 5 about appointments by Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York misspelled the given name of the deputy commissioner of the Office of Health Insurance Programs, a new position. (The error was repeated on Thursday in an article about the expected appointment of a new state health commissioner.) She is Deborah Bachrach, not Debra.</p>
