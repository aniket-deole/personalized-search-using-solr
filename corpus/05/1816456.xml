        <p>CHOCOLATE-COVERED CRICKETS &amp; OTHER EDIBLE INSECTS (Sunday) Are all cookies irresistible to children? How about chocolate-covered cricket cookies?

At Salt Marsh Nature Center (enter at 33rd Street and Avenue U), Marine Park, Brooklyn, 311 or nyc.gov/parks; free.</p>
        <p>DANCES BY VERY YOUNG CHOREOGRAPHERS (Tomorrow) The artists in this annual showcase really are very young, from elementary-school age to teenagers.
