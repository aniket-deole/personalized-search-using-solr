        <p>A 10-year-old boy hanged himself accidentally on New Year's Eve after watching reports of Saddam Hussein's execution, the police and relatives said Thursday.</p>
        <p>Family members discovered the body of the boy, Sergio Pelico, hanging from his bunk bed and called the police in Webster, between Houston and Galveston.</p>
        <p>The boy watched television reports on Saturday and asked about the execution, said an uncle, Adolfo Chavez.</p>
        <p>''He asked, 'Is this how they killed people?' '' Mr. Chavez recounted in Spanish. ''We said, 'No, but they did it to this man because he's bad.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez said his nephew had said nothing more about the hanging.</p>
        <p>The next night, as adults prepared supper and his cousins played, Sergio went upstairs to his bedroom. Another child found the body, Mr. Chavez said.</p>
        <p>Capt. Thomas Claunch of the Webster police said there was no reason to suspect suicide.</p>
        <p>''It was nothing more than a tragic accident,'' Captain Claunch said. ''I think he was trying to mimic the behavior, and it got out of hand. There were no indications of depression, no problems within the home. He was very positive.''</p>
        <p>The captain said Sergio, an only child who was in the fifth grade, had given his mother a belated Christmas card. ''In it,'' Captain Claunch said, ''he says he will do better in school this year, that he wants to get her a better Christmas present next year.''</p>
        <p>Captain Claunch said that the authorities were awaiting autopsy results but that he believed the death would be ruled accidental.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez said the family would ship the boy's body home to Guatemala for burial.</p>
