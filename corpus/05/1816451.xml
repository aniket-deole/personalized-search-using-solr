        <p>Will 2007 be another blog year? The network of grass-roots promotion and word-of-mouth Web sites that, irritatingly, has come to be called Web 2.0 -- YouTube, MySpace, etc. -- has been a significant force in music over the last year or two. And if the success of Cold War Kids is any indication, it remains a vital and effective tool for a band to build a big audience quickly, and is nowhere near the Malthusian implosion that cynics foretell. The band, above, from Long Beach, Calif., was founded in 2004, and last year found itself on the top of the music-blogger food chain, with a repertory of craggy guitars, verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown vocals and elliptical songwriting. Par for the indie-rock course, maybe, but on its debut album, ''Robbers &amp; Cowards'' (Downtown), Cold War Kids sketch unusually intense portraits of doubt and faith. ''Hospital Beds'' features two terminally ill men keeping each other company, and in ''Passing the Hat'' the thief of a church collection basket offers his defense: ''The givers not knowing where their money's going is as sinful as throwing away.'' This month the band is playing a ''bicoastal residency'': weekly gigs at three New York clubs, beginning on Wednesday at Pianos, and on Fridays in Los Angeles. (The schedule is -- where else? -- on its MySpace page, myspace.com/coldwarkids). After completing this series, the group heads out on tour with Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the Web musical phenomenon from way back in 2005. (Wednesday at 9 p.m., with the Virgins, at Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, 212-505-3733, pianosnyc.com; sold out.)</p>
