        <p>WHAT -- Resort and residential community at a ski area.  WHERE -- Stowe, Vt.  AMENITIES -- Access to skiing, a golf course, restaurants and a full-service spa, among others.  PRICES -- Available full-ownership condominiums from $1.5 million; shares of fractional units from $329,000 and cabin duplexes from $2.4 million.  STATUS -- Construction began in 2003. Cabin units, as well as home sites that have all been sold, were made available starting in 2004. The other residences are expected to be completed in the fall.  DEVELOPER -- Spruce Peak Realty.  CONTACT -- (877) 977-7823 or www.sprucepeak.com.  DETAILS In the Green Mountains of north-central Vermont, this project is the first slopeside development in Stowe, the center of a resort area long popular with weekenders -- especially in winter. It is at the foot of Spruce Peak, which is connected by a new lift to 4,393-foot Mount Mansfield, the state's tallest mountain. On 35 acres, it includes 20 one-third-acre home sites, 38 four-bedroom units in 19 cabins and a lodge building with 108 full-ownership condominiums and 34 residence club units. The lodge building will be the heart of the development, and its full-ownership condos -- studios and three-bedroom units -- will form a hotel through an optional rental program. The residence club units, two- to four-bedrooms, will be sold in one-eighth shares, with owners granted at least four weeks a year in their units. All the residences in the central lodge building will be sold furnished and will have balconies and gas fireplaces. The golf course will be 18 holes and is planned to be completed this spring. The full-service spa and fitness center is scheduled to open in the fall. Also, there are plans for performance and retail spaces to be added over the next few years.</p>
