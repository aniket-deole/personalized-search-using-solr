        <p>MAST--Aimee, 75, died peacefully on January 4th, 2007 at the Weiler Hospital of the Einstein College of Medicine after a long illness. Beloved wife, mother, grandmother, mother in law, aunt, great-aunt, niece, cousin and friend to many, she will be sorely missed by all who loved her. She is survived by her devoted husband of 47 years, Stanley, her son James, her grandson Caleb, her daughter in law Jessie Fan, her aunt Jeanine, her niece and nephews Jacqueline Fetner, Martin Mast, and Mark Fetner. Funeral services will be held January 5th at 12:00 Noon at the Weinstein Memorial Chapel 1552 Central Park Avenue just north of Tuckahoe Road on the northbound service road (914793-3800). Interment will follow At Mt. Hebron Cemetery in Queens. A graduate of Barnard College and NYU, she worked as a medical editor and staff assistant at CPMC, producing one of the first compendiums on birth control around the world in the 1960s. She was a member of the Conservative Synagogue Adath Israel of Riverdale, the New York Academy of Sciences and the Riverdale Mental Health Association. Aimee, born in Paris, and her parents fled France in 1942, and made a new and happy life in the United States. The family will sit shiva on return from the cemetery, Saturday night, Monday, and Tuesday.</p>
        <p>MAST--Aimee Simone. The Board of Directors of The Riverdale Mental Health Association offers its most sincere sympathy to our Board member, Stanley Mast, and his family on the loss of his beloved wife of 47 years. May he find comfort in the memory of their devotion to each other. Sandra E. Lerner, President Robert Brewster, Exec. Dir.</p>
