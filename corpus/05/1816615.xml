        <p>By refusing to allow radio antennas atop their water tank towers, several water districts are blocking completion of Nassau County's new $50 million emergency communications system linking police, fire and ambulance agencies, county officials said yesterday. The project was prompted by the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, which underscored flawed communications in New York City. Some water districts are seeking rental fees from the county, which does not want to pay. ''It's outrageous that that some water districts are attempting to put profit ahead of public safety,'' Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive, said at a news conference at a 180-foot Jericho Water District tower.</p>
