        <p>VAN HENGEL--Maarten. The Phelps Memorial Hospital Center community mourns the passing of longtime friend and esteemed former Board Chairman, Maarten van Hengel, who was associated with Phelps for more than 30 years. He also served as Chairman of the Board of the Stellaris Health Network. He initiated the discussions and saw to fruition Phelps' partnership with The Kendal on Hudson continuing care retirement community. Maarten van Hengel's efforts will benefit the Hospital and the community for decades to come. We extend our deepest condolences to Maarten's devoted wife Drusilla, his children Maarten and Claudia van Hengel; Ginny and John Loughlin; Hugh and Mary Ann van Hengel; and Drusilla van Hengel and Joshua Patlak; and his five grandchildren: Peter, Christina, Katherine, Emily, and Riley. C. Edward Midgley, Chairman, Board of Directors Keith F. Safian, President &amp; CEO Elio Ippolito, M.D., President of the Medical Staff</p>
        <p>VAN HENGEL--Maarten. The directors and members of the Netherland-America Foundation mourn the death of Mr. Maarten van Hengel, its former chairman and director. Maarten provided the building blocks and injected leadership into the Foundation in the early 1990s allowing the Foundation to grow into a vital pillar in the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands. Maarten's enthusiasm for, and commitment to, educational and cultural exchange between the two countries were exemplary and have inspired many current and former directors, members and contributors. His wisdom, guidance and support will be missed. We are grateful for Maarten's invaluable contributions and his friendship. We send our heartfelt condolences to Drusilla, the children and their spouses, all grandchildren and other members of the Van Hengel family on both sides of the Atlantic. On behalf of the NetherlandAmerica Foundation, Ennius E. Bergsma, Chairman</p>
