        <p>MORSE--Jane H., M.D. We are saddened by the passing of Jane H. Morse, Professor Emeritus of Clinical Medicine, College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons. Dr. Morse was not only a scientific pioneer but a truly remarkable woman with tireless energy and a great passion and dedication to discovery. Dr. Morse served as a faculty member for more than 40 years, and discovered the gene for familial primary pulmonary hypertension. In 2007, the Office of Gender Equity and the Center for Women's Health honored Dr. Morse as an exceptional role model for academic scientists and for her lifelong commitment to medical students, residents, and fellows.
