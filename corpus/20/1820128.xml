        <p>State education officials in Georgia mishandled their part in Reading First, a $1-billion- a-year federal program intended to teach low-income children to read by third grade, a report by the federal Education Department's inspector general found. The report said officials set unwarranted restrictions on local districts, creating ''the appearance of preferential treatment'' for a handful of programs. The state also failed to protect against conflict of interest, hiring the author of one program competing for use in Reading First schools to screen grant applications submitted by districts. Kathy Cox, the state school superintendent, said several of the audit's findings had been remedied.</p>
