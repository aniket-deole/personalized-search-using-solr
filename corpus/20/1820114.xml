        <p>The addition of Liev Schreiber to the cast of ''CSI'' helped give CBS the top spot Thursday night, but ''Ugly Betty'' and ''Grey's Anatomy,'' which both won Golden Globes on Monday, put ABC on top among adults 18 to 49. According to Nielsen's estimates, 21.3 million viewers tuned in at 9 p.m. for ''CSI,'' ranking it just behind ''Grey's Anatomy,'' which had 21.9 million viewers in the same time slot. CBS led during the 10 p.m. hour opposite a repeat of NBC's ''ER'' (6.1 million), as ''Shark'' (15 million) matched its season's best ratings in the 18 to 49 demographic. ABC's ''Ugly Betty'' drew the most total viewers (14.1 million) at 8, while the lead in the 18-to-49 demographic went to NBC's ''My Name Is Earl'' at 8 (9.7 million) and ''The Office'' at 8:30 (9.3 million). NBC, with ''Scrubs'' at 9 (6.6 million) and ''30 Rock'' at 9:30 (5.1 million), was third for the night.</p>
