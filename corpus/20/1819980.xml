        <p>TUMKOVSKY--Antonina. The entire School of American Ballet family deeply mourns the death of Antonina Tumkovsky; we shall all miss her indomitable spirit. Tumey was a favorite teacher at the School for more than fifty years. Her daily classes were exacting and exhausting, speedy and precise, whether for eight-yearold beginners or for advanced women. Never one to overanalyze, she simply demanded that her students ''do, do, do.'' Peter Martins, Chairman of Faculty Kay Mazzo, Co-Chairman Marjorie Van Dercook, Executive Director</p>
