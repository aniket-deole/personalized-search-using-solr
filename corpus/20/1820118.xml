        <p>Thousands of civilians waving white flags fled from heavy fighting in the east of the country as government forces captured a strategic town held by the separatist Tamil Tigers after weeks of fierce fighting. The town, Vakarai, on the northeastern coast, is a main link between the northern and eastern areas controlled by the rebels. ''Since dawn, 6,000 to 8,000 people have been moving on foot, by tractor and by sea,'' a United Nations spokeswoman, Ola Clinton, said. ''They were waving white flags and handkerchiefs.'' She said that as fighting intensified in recent weeks, 25,000 people had already fled Vakarai, and she estimated that another 2,000 to 2,500 civilians remained, with food in short supply.</p>
