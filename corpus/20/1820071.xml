        <p>Two men were found dead yesterday evening in a garage in Brooklyn that was damaged by a fire, officials said.</p>

        <p>Two men were found dead yesterday evening in a garage in Brooklyn that was damaged by a fire, officials said.</p>
        <p>The bodies of the men, who had not been identified as of late last night, were discovered after firefighters put out a fire in a one-story garage at 1695 East 21st Street near Kings Highway in Midwood, a neighborhood of well-kept two-story homes and brick buildings.</p>
        <p>The blaze began just after 5 p.m. and was brought under control at 5:50 p.m. after 12 fire trucks and 60 firefighters responded, a Fire Department spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Last night, police tape was set up around the garage as police and fire investigators tried to learn the cause of the fire and how the two men died.</p>
        <p>According to residents, the garage belonged to a medical office next door but was rarely used. It was often left unlocked or open, the neighbors said.</p>
        <p>Ismael Rivera, 52, a parole officer who lives nearby, said two friendly homeless men in the area who were often seen in a park on Kings Highway had been using the garage for shelter in the past week.</p>
        <p>On a few occasions, he said, the two men were seen in the garage burning debris to stay warm.</p>
        <p>It was unclear, however, whether they were the men who were found dead after the fire. Other residents said that on Thursday night, firefighters put out a small blaze in the garage.</p>
        <p>Ben Shalamov, 30, a dental technician, said that the two homeless men were last seen in the garage around 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon. He described one of the men as Armenian, and said he had told people he had an ex-wife and two children in Russia.</p>
        <p>Often the man, who looked to be in his 50s, would sit on benches in the neighborhood, smiling and reciting poetry as people walked by, Mr. Shalamov said.</p>
        <p>He said that in the past few weeks, the man had been seen hobbling around on crutches.</p>
        <p>''It's sad,'' Mr. Shalamov said. ''They were harmless. They were nice guys who never bothered you.''</p>
