        <p>Some of the Bears players grumbled this week about the fact that there were 6,000 empty seats at Soldier Field for their second-round playoff game Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
        <p>They said they would prefer a louder crowd this Sunday, when they play host to the New Orleans Saints in the National Football Conference championship game, but they would settle for a howling wind.</p>
        <p>The game-day forecast calls for temperatures in the upper 20s, with snow flurries and winds of 10 to 15 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>That qualifies as glorious weather for the Bears.</p>
        <p>It was 17 degrees the last time an N.F.C. title game was played at Soldier Field, on Jan. 8, 1989. The Bears were defeated by the San Francisco 49ers, 28-3, but it was not the cold that psyched them out that day. It was 49ers quarterback Joe Montana.</p>
        <p>To hear them talk, it can never get too cold in January for these Bears. ''I would like for it to be 5 degrees,'' Thomas Jones, the team's leading rusher, said Friday.</p>
        <p>The coldest conditions the Saints have endured this season came in their Christmas Eve game against the Giants in East Rutherford, N.J., where the temperature at kickoff was 52 degrees.</p>
        <p>It was 32 degrees, with a wind chill of 22 degrees, at the start of the Bears' game against Seattle, which Chicago won in overtime, 27-24.</p>
        <p>''What kind of weather would I like to see?'' Bears Coach Lovie Smith said.</p>
        <p>''We want Chicago Bear weather -- exactly what we're going to get. I think it's different playing here in the cold. The conditions don't really matter, but if we have to play we'd rather play in our conditions.''</p>
