        <p>The Los Angeles Opera's home, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, is to undergo a major renovation, officials of the opera house and its landlord said. The renovation, expected to last a year, will cost ''somewhere north of $100 million'' and possibly as much as $150 million, said Stephen D. Rountree, president and chief executive of the Music Center of Los Angeles County, which includes the pavilion. The renovation, which will not take place before 2011, will not touch the exterior but will improve public spaces, backstage areas and acoustics, Mr. Rountree said. A spokesman for the opera company said it was contemplating bunching performances before and after the renovation, and possibly touring Japan during that period.</p>
