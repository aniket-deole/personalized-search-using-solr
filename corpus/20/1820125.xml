        <p>Twenty-four illegal immigrants were arrested on Wednesday after trying to enter Fort Benning to do construction work, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. All but three are facing federal charges of identity theft, use of fraudulent documents or re-entering the United States after deportation. In Nevada, the authorities said, two illegal immigrants employed as masons were arrested on Thursday at Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs. In Virginia, immigration agents on Thursday arrested Richard Eversole, 58, an American citizen, and Juan Martínez, 24, a Mexican, on federal harboring charges, accusing them of hiring illegal immigrants to work on a construction project at the Quantico Marine Corps Base, and leasing apartments for the men.</p>
