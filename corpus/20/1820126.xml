        <p>The Episcopal Diocese of Virginia has announced that it intends to ''recover or secure'' the property of 11 churches that voted in December to leave the Episcopal Church and affiliate with an Anglican archbishop with whom they share conservative views on homosexuality and scripture. Many of the congregations had hoped to retain their property by reimbursing the diocese, but now both sides are preparing for a legal battle. The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Katharine Jefferts Schori, said in a statement, ''While individuals have the right and privilege to depart or return at any time, congregations do not.''</p>
