        <p>In an interview with the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz, King Abdullah II said Jordan wanted to develop a peaceful nuclear program. With the comments, Jordan joined Egypt and several Persian Gulf states that have announced intentions to develop peaceful nuclear programs. The king's statement was widely seen as a continuation of the political posturing of Arab leaders who have grown fearful that the West will fail to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions. Last month, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, made up of Iran's Arab neighbors, agreed to begin a study into developing a nuclear research and development center somewhere in the Persian Gulf.</p>
