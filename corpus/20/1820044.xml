      <abstract>
        <p>Verlyn Klinkenborg, in Appreciations editorial, celebrates prefix 'post-'; holds that most innovative user of prefix post- is post-Austrian governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says that he is now engaging in 'post-partisan' politics; says even most political candidates may come to think of post-partisanship as necessary precursor of being pre-presidential</p>

        <p>It may seem odd to celebrate a prefix. After all, it isn't even a whole part of speech. It does for a word, visually, what a big cigar does for a small man. But even as prefixes go, ''post-'' is unusually adaptable. It signifies transcendence, surpassing, moving past, leaving behind, and yet it does all these things while remaining attached to the very thing the prefix is leaving in the dust.</p>
        <p>It is even capable of compounding itself. We are, of course, no longer postmodern but post-postmodern, if not in fact post-post-postmodern, which would make us not pomo, but popomo. We cling to post- in part because we have no idea what we are pre-. In these prefixes -- post- and pre- -- there is a world of wonderful confusion. Think only of the Pre-Raphaelites who were actually Victorians and thus, in fact, Post-Raphaelites.</p>

        <p>It may seem odd to celebrate a prefix. After all, it isn't even a whole part of speech. It does for a word, visually, what a big cigar does for a small man. But even as prefixes go, ''post-'' is unusually adaptable.

        <p>It is even capable of compounding itself. We are, of course, no longer postmodern but post-postmodern, if not in fact post-post-postmodern, which would make us not pomo, but popomo. We cling to post- in part because we have no idea what we are pre-. In these prefixes -- post- and pre- -- there is a world of wonderful confusion. Think only of the Pre-Raphaelites who were actually Victorians and thus, in fact, Post-Raphaelites.</p>
        <p>The most innovative user of the prefix post-these days is the post-Austrian governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says that he is now engaging in ''post-partisan'' politics. He has a serious point, which is that the number of independent voters in the state is growing even as the number of registered Republicans and Democrats is dropping. To many of those independent voters, the arcane machinery of party politics may look a little antiquated, especially since the current occupant of the White House seems to be post-Republican -- even post-electoral -- though, of course, never post-partisan.</p>
        <p>But calling himself post-partisan is really Mr. Schwarzenegger's way of cutting himself free from the political agenda of his nominal party. A few other politicians -- Michael Bloomberg, for instance -- might well use the word too.</p>
        <p>The beautiful irony of it all is that there is nothing remotely post-political in being post-partisan. Even the most political candidates may come to think of post-partisanship as a necessary precursor to being pre-presidential.</p>
